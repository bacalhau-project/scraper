"Read about Babylon"Kubernetes is a great solution for us. It allows us to rapidly iterate on our clients' demands.
"Read about Booz Allen Hamilton"We realized that we needed to learn Kubernetes better in order to fully use the potential of it. At that point, we made the shift to build our own Kubernetes platform.

"Read about AppDirect"Kubernetes has the opportunity to be the new cloud platform. The amount of innovation that's going to come from being able to standardize on Kubernetes as a platform is incredibly exciting - more exciting than anything I've seen in the last 10 years of working on the cloud.
