This minimal performance impact was judged a reasonable investment for the breadth of monitoring and debugging information returned.Write QPS to cluster leaders seems to be increased by a small margin. This is because the main loop and entry apply loops were decoupled in the etcd raft logic, eliminating several blocks between them.Write QPS to all members seems to be increased by a significant margin, because followers now receive the latest commit index sooner, and commit proposals more quickly.FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it!
