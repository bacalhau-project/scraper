checkRestoring a corrupted memberPurge member persistent stateReplace memberRestore whole clusterVersionsv3.6-DRAFTOperations guideData CorruptionData Corruptionetcd data corruption and recoveryetcd has built in automated data corruption detection to prevent member state from diverging.Enabling data corruption detectionData corruption detection can be done using:Initial check, enabled with--experimental-initial-corrupt-checkflag.Periodic check of:Compacted revision hash, enabled with--experimental-compact-hash-check-enabledflag.Latest revision hash, enabled with--experimental-corrupt-check-timeflag.Initial check will be executed during bootstrap of etcd member.
Member will compare its persistent state vs other members and exit if there is a mismatch.Both periodic check will be executed by the cluster leader in a cluster that is already running.
Leader will compare its persistent state vs other members and raise a CORRUPT ALARM if there is a mismatch.
Both checks serve the same purpose, however they are both worth enabling to balance performance and time to detection.Compacted revision hash check - requires regular compaction, minimal performance cost, handles slow followers.Latest revision hash check - high performance cost, doesn’t handle slow followers or frequent compactions.Compacted revision hash checkWhen enabled using--experimental-compact-hash-check-enabledflag, check will be executed once every minute.
This can be adjusted using--experimental-compact-hash-check-timeflag using format:1m- every minute,1h- evey hour.
This check extends compaction to also calculate checksum that can be compared between cluster members.
Doesn’t cause additional database scan making it very cheap, but requiring a regular compaction in cluster.Latest revision hash checkEnabled using--experimental-corrupt-check-timeflag, requires providing an execution period in format:1m- every minute,1h- evey hour.
Recommended period is a couple of hours due to a high performance cost.
Running a check requires computing a checksum by scanning entire etcd content at given revision.Restoring a corrupted memberThere are three ways to restore a corrupted member:Purge member persistent stateReplace memberRestore whole clusterAfter the corrupted member is restored, CORRUPT ALARM can be removed.Purge member persistent stateMembers state can be purged by:Stopping the etcd instance.Backing up etcd data directory.Moving out thesnapsubdirectory from the etcd data directory.Startingetcdwith--initial-cluster-state=existingand cluster members listed in--initial-cluster.Etcd member is expected to download up-to-date snapshot from the leader.Replace memberMember can be replaced by:Stopping the etcd instance.Backing up the etcd data directory.Removing the data directory.Removing the member from cluster by runningetcdctl member remove.Adding it back by runningetcdctl member addStartingetcdwith--initial-cluster-state=existingand cluster members listed in--initial-cluster.Restore whole clusterCluster can be restored by saving a snapshot from current leader and restoring it to all members.
Runetcdctl snapshot saveagainst the leader and followrestoring a cluster procedure.FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it! Pleasetell us how we can improve.Sorry to hear that. Pleasetell us how we can improve.Last modified September 17, 2023:Change from it's to its (070ed10)©
