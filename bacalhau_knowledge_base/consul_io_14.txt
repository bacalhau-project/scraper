It solves the networking and security challenges of operating microservices and cloud infrastructure in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. This documentation describes Consul concepts, the problems it solves, and contains quick-start tutorials for using Consul.APICLIUse casesService meshConsul service mesh provides service-to-service connection authorization and encryption using mutual transport layer security (TLS).Register mesh servicesDefine and register services with Consul and associate them with health checks.Configure mesh behaviorThe exported services configuration entry enables you to export services from a single file.Manage mesh trafficGateways provide connectivity into, out of, and between Consul service meshes.Control ingress trafficDeploy a Consul API gateway to manage north-south network traffic .KubernetesConsul has many integrations with Kubernetes. You can deploy Consul to Kubernetes using the Helm chart or Consul K8s CLI, sync services between Consul and Kubernetes, run Consul service mesh, and more.Install Consul on KubernetesConsul runs directly on Kubernetes to support pure K8s workloads. You can also join workloads to Consul servers outside of Kubernetes to support mixed environments.Simplify service mesh on Kubernetes with Consul DataplaneConsul Dataplane manages proxies but leaves responsibility for other functions to the orchestrator, removing the need to run client agents on every node.Connect services deployed to multiple Kubernetes clustersInstall and federate Consul on multiple Kubernetes clusters.Sync Kubernetes and Consul servicesAutomatically sync your Kubernetes and Consul services to seamlessly secure communications between your Kubernetes and Consul services.Network infrastructure automationConsul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) enables dynamic updates to network infrastructure devices triggered by service changes.Install and configure the CTSInstall the CTS binary.Define dynamic updatesConfigure CTS Tasks to automatically update network infrastructure when your Consul services change.Create a Terraform moduleAutomatically execute Terraform modules for network infrastructure automation with CTS.PlatformsConsul integrates with several platforms and products. Learn more about Consul integrations and how to enable them.NomadUse Consul service mesh with Nomad to provide secure service to service communication between Nomad jobs.VaultUse Consul with Vault to manage and sign certificates. The Vault CA provider uses the Vault PKI secrets engine to generate and sign certificates.AWS ECSDeploy Consul service mesh on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service).AWS LambdaIntegrate AWS Lambda with Consul services by registering Lambda functions as Consul services and invoking them from your service mesh.DevelopersEnvoy integrationHTTP API structureDownload Consul toolsGitHub samplesOn this page:Consul DocumentationUse casesDevelopersThemeCertificationsSystem StatusCookie ManagerTerms of UseSecurityPrivacyTrademark PolicyTrade ControlsAccessibilityGive Feedback(opens in new tab)
