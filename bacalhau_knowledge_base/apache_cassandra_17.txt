You can guarantee this holds true by running your application workloads against the Beta release and contributing to the communityâs validation effort to get Cassandra 4.0 to GA.Read MoreEven Higher Availability with 5x Faster Streaming in Cassandra 4.0April 09, 2019Streaming is a process where nodes of a cluster exchange data in the form of SSTables. Streaming can kick in during many situations such as bootstrap, repair, rebuild, range movement, cluster expansion, etc. In this post, we discuss the massive performance improvements made to the streaming process in Apache Cassandra 4.0.Read MoreIntroducing Transient ReplicationDecember 03, 2018Transient Replication is a new experimental feature soon to be available in 4.0. When enabled, it allows for the creation of keyspaces where replication factor can be specified as a number of copies (full replicas) and temporary copies (transient replicas). Transient replicas retain the data they replicate only long enough for it to be propagated to full replicas, via incremental repair, at which point the data is deleted. Writing to transient replicas can be avoided almost entirely if monotonic reads are not required because it is possible to achieve a quorum of acknowledged writes without them.Read MoreAudit Logging in Apache Cassandra 4.0October 29, 2018Database audit logging is an industry standard tool for enterprises to capture critical data change events including what data changed and who triggered the event.

There are several projects and methodologies that the community is undertaking to this end. One of these is the adoption of property-based testing, which was previously introduced here. This post will take a look at a specific use of this approach and how it found a bug in a new feature meant to ensure data integrity between the client and Cassandra.Read MoreTesting Apache Cassandra 4.0August 21, 2018With the goal of ensuring reliability and stability in Apache Cassandra 4.0, the projectâs committers have voted to freeze new features on September 1 to concentrate on testing and validation before cutting a stable beta. Towards that goal, the community is investing in methodologies that can be performed at scale to exercise edge cases in the largest Cassandra clusters. The result, we hope, is to make Apache Cassandra 4.0 the best-tested and most reliable major release right out of the gate.Read MoreHardware-bound Zero Copy Streaming in Apache Cassandra 4.0August 07, 2018Streaming in Apache Cassandra powers host replacement, range movements, and cluster expansions. Streaming plays a crucial role in the cluster and as such its performance is key to not only the speed of the operations its used in but the clusterâs health generally. In Apache Cassandra 4.0, we have introduced an improved streaming implementation that reduces GC pressure and increases throughput several folds and are now limited, in some cases, only by the disk / network IO (See: CASSANDRA-14556).Read MoreGet started with Cassandra, fast.Quickstart GuideApache Cassandrapowers mission-critical deployments with improved performance and unparalleled levels of scale in the cloud.HomeCassandra BasicsQuickstartEcosystemDocumentationCommunityCase StudiesResourcesBlogFoundationEventsLicenseThanksSecurityPrivacySponsorshipÂ© 2009-The Apache Software Foundationunder the terms of the Apache License 2.0.
