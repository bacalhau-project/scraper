Add the Apache Cassandra repository keys:
curl -o /etc/apt/keyrings/apache-cassandra.asc https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS
Add the Apache repository of Cassandra to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
, for example for the latest 4.1
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/apache-cassandra.asc] https://debian.cassandra.apache.org 41x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
Update the repositories:
sudo apt-get update
Install Cassandra:
sudo apt-get install cassandra
You can start Cassandra with sudo service cassandra start
and stop it with sudo service cassandra stop
. However, normally the service will start automatically. For this reason be sure to stop it if you need to make any configuration changes.
Verify that Cassandra is running by invoking nodetool status
from the command line.
The default location of configuration files is /etc/cassandra
.
The default location of log and data directories is /var/log/cassandra/
and /var/lib/cassandra
.
Start-up options (heap size, etc) can be configured in /etc/default/cassandra
.

(Not all versions of Apache Cassandra are available, since building RPMs is a recent addition to the project.)
For CentOS 7 and similar (rpm < 4.14), append the noboolean
repository
Add the Apache repository of Cassandra to /etc/yum.repos.d/cassandra.repo
, for example for the latest 4.0 version:
[cassandra]
name=Apache Cassandra
baseurl=https://redhat.cassandra.apache.org/41x/
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS
Or for CentOS 7:
[cassandra]
name=Apache Cassandra
baseurl=https://redhat.cassandra.apache.org/41x/noboolean/
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS
Install Cassandra, accepting the gpg key import prompts:
sudo yum install cassandra
Start Cassandra (will not start automatically):
service cassandra start
Systemd based distributions may require to run systemctl daemon-reload
once to make Cassandra available as a systemd service. This should happen automatically by running the command above.
Make Cassandra start automatically after reboot:
chkconfig cassandra on
Please note that official RPMs for Apache Cassandra only have been available recently and are not tested thoroughly on all platforms yet. We appreciate your feedback and support and ask you to post details on any issues in the corresponding Jira ticket.
