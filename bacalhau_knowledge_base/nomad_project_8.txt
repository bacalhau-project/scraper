Each of these applications has unique performance requirements and runs on various processors, operating systems, and device types. It becomes difficult to manage geographically distributed edge environments with automated and operationally efficient workflows.SolutionA distributed single-cluster topology to deploy and scale edge workloads without additional complexityWith Nomad, you can build a single, consolidated workflow that gives you the flexibility and control that is necessary to fit the unique requirements of each application at the edge. Nomad’s support for device plugins allows it to take advantage of hardware running on specialized devices and you can deploy Nomad with a single-cluster topology on hybrid infrastructure to place workloads to the cloud or at the edge.Customer case studyConnecting farms and growing plants at Bowery FarmingBowery Farming uses Nomad and Consul to power their network of indoor farms with highly available services in the cloud and on-premises.Read more2 weeksto deploy Nomad from PoC into production1 SREto manage Nomad7ximprovement in resource utilizationDocsExplore allDocumentationDevice pluginsNomad’s support for device plugins allows it to take advantage of hardware running on specialized devices.DocumentationSystem batch schedulingSystem batch scheduling is useful for issuing cluster-wide, short-lived tasks and are useful for updating jobs, monitoring, or doing one-off maintenance tasks.DocumentationNomad architectureRead through a glossary of Nomad terminology and learn about single and multi-region deployment architecure patterns.TutorialsExplore allTutorialRolling updatesSet up rolling updates for a job or task group.TutorialSecure Nomad with access controlConfigure a Nomad cluster for ACLs, bootstrap the ACL system, author your first policy, and grant a token based on it.Get started managing edge deployments with NomadNomad addresses the technical complexity of managing workloads in production at scale by providing a simple and flexible workload orchestrator across distributed infrastructure and clouds.Download NomadDocsAPICommunityPrivacySecurityConsent ManagerManage cookiesHashiCorp uses data collected by cookies and JavaScript libraries to improve your browsing experience, analyze site traffic, and increase the overall performance of our site.
