With this in mind, we always recommend performing benchmarks using an environment as close to your production use as possible.This tutorial video shows you how you can easily use the NATS CLI tool to test and benchmark Core NATS and JetStream NATS functionality in order to generate your own set of benchmark numbers using your own target environment.About the AuthorJean-Noël Moyne is Technical Solutions Lead atSynadia Communications.Questions?
