This operation always succeeds, meaning ops paired with this operation will also appear to succeed, even though they may not have.◆OP_RECV_INITIAL_METADATAconst Grpc\OP_RECV_INITIAL_METADATAReceive initial metadata: one and only one MUST be made on the client, must not be made on the server.This op completes after all initial metadata has been read from the peer.◆OP_RECV_MESSAGEconst Grpc\OP_RECV_MESSAGEReceive a message: 0 or more of these operations can occur for each call.This op completes after all bytes of the received message have been read, or after a half-close has been received on this call.◆OP_RECV_STATUS_ON_CLIENTconst Grpc\OP_RECV_STATUS_ON_CLIENTReceive status on the client: one and only one must be made on the client.This operation always succeeds, meaning ops paired with this operation will also appear to succeed, even though they may not have. In that case the status will indicate some failure. This op completes after all activity on the call has completed.◆OP_SEND_CLOSE_FROM_CLIENTconst Grpc\OP_SEND_CLOSE_FROM_CLIENTSend a close from the client: one and only one instance MUST be sent from the client, unless the call was cancelled - in which case this can be skipped.This op completes after all bytes for the call (including the close) have passed outgoing flow control.◆OP_SEND_INITIAL_METADATAconst Grpc\OP_SEND_INITIAL_METADATASend initial metadata: one and only one instance MUST be sent for each call, unless the call was cancelled - in which case this can be skipped.This op completes after all bytes of metadata have been accepted by outgoing flow control.◆OP_SEND_MESSAGEconst Grpc\OP_SEND_MESSAGESend a message: 0 or more of these operations can occur for each call.This op completes after all bytes for the message have been accepted by outgoing flow control.◆OP_SEND_STATUS_FROM_SERVERconst Grpc\OP_SEND_STATUS_FROM_SERVERSend status from the server: one and only one instance MUST be sent from the server unless the call was cancelled - in which case this can be skipped.This op completes after all bytes for the call (including the status) have passed outgoing flow control.◆STATUS_ABORTEDconst Grpc\STATUS_ABORTEDThe operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts, etc.See litmus test above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.◆STATUS_ALREADY_EXISTSconst Grpc\STATUS_ALREADY_EXISTSSome entity that we attempted to create (e.g., file or directory) already exists.◆STATUS_CANCELLEDconst Grpc\STATUS_CANCELLEDThe operation was cancelled (typically by the caller).◆STATUS_DATA_LOSSconst Grpc\STATUS_DATA_LOSSUnrecoverable data loss or corruption.◆STATUS_DEADLINE_EXCEEDEDconst Grpc\STATUS_DEADLINE_EXCEEDEDDeadline expired before operation could complete.For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire.◆STATUS_FAILED_PRECONDITIONconst Grpc\STATUS_FAILED_PRECONDITIONOperation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.For example, directory to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE: (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION should be returned since the client should not retry unless they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it. (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting read-modify-write on the same resource.◆STATUS_INTERNALconst Grpc\STATUS_INTERNALInternal errors.Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken.◆STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENTconst Grpc\STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENTClient specified an invalid argument.Note that this differs from FAILED_PRECONDITION. INVALID_ARGUMENT indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed file name).◆STATUS_NOT_FOUNDconst Grpc\STATUS_NOT_FOUNDSome requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.◆STATUS_OKconst Grpc\STATUS_OKNot an error; returned on success.◆STATUS_OUT_OF_RANGEconst Grpc\STATUS_OUT_OF_RANGEOperation was attempted past the valid range.E.g., seeking or reading past end of file.Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file size.There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and OUT_OF_RANGE. We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when they are done.◆STATUS_PERMISSION_DENIEDconst Grpc\STATUS_PERMISSION_DENIEDThe caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.PERMISSION_DENIED must not be used for rejections caused by exhausting some resource (use RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead for those errors). PERMISSION_DENIED must not be used if the caller can not be identified (use UNAUTHENTICATED instead for those errors).◆STATUS_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTEDconst Grpc\STATUS_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTEDSome resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.◆STATUS_UNAUTHENTICATEDconst Grpc\STATUS_UNAUTHENTICATEDThe request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation.◆STATUS_UNAVAILABLEconst Grpc\STATUS_UNAVAILABLEThe service is currently unavailable.This is a most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations.WARNING: Although data MIGHT not have been transmitted when this status occurs, there is NOT A GUARANTEE that the server has not seen anything. So in general it is unsafe to retry on this status code if the call is non-idempotent.See litmus test above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.◆STATUS_UNIMPLEMENTEDconst Grpc\STATUS_UNIMPLEMENTEDOperation is not implemented or not supported/enabled in this service.◆STATUS_UNKNOWNconst Grpc\STATUS_UNKNOWNUnknown error.An example of where this error may be returned is if aStatusvalue received from another address space belongs to an error-space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error.◆WRITE_BUFFER_HINTconst Grpc\WRITE_BUFFER_HINTHint that the write may be buffered and need not go out on the wire immediately.GRPC is free to buffer the message until the next non-buffered write, or until writes_done, but it need not buffer completely or at all.◆WRITE_NO_COMPRESSconst Grpc\WRITE_NO_COMPRESSForce compression to be disabled for a particular write (start_write/add_metadata).Illegal on invoke/accept.Generated on Thu Aug 22 2024 20:30:32 for GRPC PHP by1.8.17
