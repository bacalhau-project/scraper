projectâ€™s golang modulesThe etcd project (since version 3.5) is organized into multiplegolang moduleshosted in asingle repository.There are following modules:go.etcd.io/etcd/api/v3- contains API definitions
(like protos & proto-generated libraries) that defines communication protocol
between etcd clients and server.go.etcd.io/etcd/pkg/v3- collection of utility packages used by etcd
without being specific to etcd itself. A package belongs here
only if it could possibly be moved out into its own repository in the future.
Please avoid adding here code that has a lot of dependencies on its own, as
they automatically becoming dependencies of the client library
(that we want to keep lightweight).go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3- client library used to contact etcd over
the network (grpc). Recommended for all new usage of etcd.go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v2- legacy client library used to contact etcd
over HTTP protocol. Deprecated. All new usage should depend on /v3 library.go.etcd.io/etcd/raft/v3- implementation of distributed consensus
protocol. Should have no etcd specific code.go.etcd.io/etcd/server/v3- etcd implementation.
The code in this package is etcd internal and should not be consumed
by external projects. The package layout and API can change within the minor versions.go.etcd.io/etcd/etcdctl/v3- a command line tool to access and manage etcd.go.etcd.io/etcd/tests/v3- a module that contains all integration tests of etcd.
Notice: All unit-tests (fast and not requiring cross-module dependencies)
should be kept in the local modules to the code under the test.go.etcd.io/bbolt- implementation of persistent b-tree.
Hosted in a separate repository:https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt.OperationsAll etcd modules should be released in the same versions, e.g.go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3@v3.5.10must depend ongo.etcd.io/etcd/api/v3@v3.5.10.The consistent updating of versions can by performed using:%DRY_RUN=falseTARGET_VERSION="v3.5.10"./scripts/release_mod.sh update_versionsThe released modules should be tagged according tohttps://golang.org/ref/mod#vcs-versionrules,
i.e. each module should get its own tag.
The tagging can be performed using:%DRY_RUN=falseREMOTE_REPO="origin"./scripts/release_mod.sh push_mod_tagsAll etcd modules should depend on the same versions of underlying dependencies.
This can be verified using:%PASSES="dep"./test.shThe go.mod files must not contain dependencies not being used and must
conform togo mod tidyformat.
This is being verified by:% PASSES="mod_tidy" ./test.shTo trigger actions across all modules (e.g. auto-format all files), please
use/expand the following script:% ./scripts/fix.shFutureAs a North Star, we would like to evaluate etcd modules towards following model:This assumes:Splitting etcdmigrate/etcdadm out of etcdctl binary.
Thanks to this etcdctl would become clearly a command-line wrapper
around network client API,
while etcdmigrate/etcdadm would support direct physical operations on the
etcd storage files.Splitting etcd-proxy out of ./etcd binary, as it contains more experimental code
so carries additional risk & dependencies.Deprecation of support for v2 protocol.FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it! Pleasetell us how we can improve.Sorry to hear that. Pleasetell us how we can improve.Last modified February 28, 2022:Create doc branch for v3.6 (9ed5c74)Â©
