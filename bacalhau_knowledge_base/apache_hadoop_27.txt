These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.
All of the default charset usages have been replaced to UTF-8. If the default charset of your environment is not UTF-8, the behavior can be different.
Use modified jersey-json 1.20 in [https://github.com/pjfanning/jersey-1.x/tree/v1.20](https://github.com/pjfanning/jersey-1.x/tree/v1.20) that uses Jackson 2.x. By this change, Jackson 1.x dependency has been removed from Hadoop. downstream applications which explicitly exclude jersey from transitive dependencies must now exclude com.github.pjfanning:jersey-json
Namenode metrics that represent Slownode Json now include three important factors (median, median absolute deviation, upper latency limit) that can help user determine how urgently a given slownode requires manual intervention.
S3A filesytem’s createFile() operation supports an option to disable all safety checks when creating a file. Consult the documentation and use with care
In preparation for an (incompatible but necessary) move to the AWS SDK v2, some uses of internal/deprecated uses of AWS classes/interfaces are logged as warnings, though only once during the life of a JVM. Set the log “org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.SDKV2Upgrade” to only log at INFO to hide these.
The [swift://](swift://) connector for openstack support has been removed. It had fundamental problems (swift’s handling of files > 4GB). A subset of the S3 protocol is now exported by almost all object store services -please use that through the s3a connector instead. The hadoop-openstack jar remains, only now it is empty of code. This is to ensure that projects which declare the JAR a dependency will still have successful builds.
bouncy castle 1.68+ is a multirelease JAR containing java classes compiled for different target JREs. older versions of asm.jar and maven shade plugin may have problems with these. fix: upgrade the dependencies
ABFS block prefetching has been disabled to avoid HADOOP-18521 and buffer sharing on multithreaded processes (Hive, Spark etc). This will have little/no performance impact on queries against Parquet or ORC data, but can slow down sequential stream processing, including CSV files -however, the read data will be correct. It may slow down distcp downloads, where the race condition does not arise. For maximum distcp performance re-enable the readahead by setting fs.abfs.enable.readahead to true.
