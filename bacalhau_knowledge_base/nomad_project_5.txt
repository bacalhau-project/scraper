Documentation
Docker driver
The Docker driver handles downloading containers, mapping ports, and starting, watching, and cleaning up after containers.
Use case
Deploy, manage, and scale enterprise containers in production with ease.
Challenge
Containers continue to help organizations move fast, but running containers in production at scale requires orchestration. Feature-rich container orchestrators, like Kubernetes, have steep learning curves and complex Day 2 operations to follow and often require a high budget and full-time staffing to maintain the platform.
Solution
Nomad supports a first-class [Docker workflow](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker) and integrates seamlessly with [HashiCorp Consul](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/integrations/consul-integration) and [Vault](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/integrations/vault-integration) to enable a complete solution while maximizing operational flexibility. Nomad is easy to use, can scale to thousands of nodes in a single cluster, and can easily deploy across private datacenters and multiple clouds.
After changes to installation scripts had side effects on other services, Trivago made the decision to set up private cloud infrastructure for their monitoring and performance services. They wanted a solution that had the ability to handle stateful, stateless, and I/O intensive jobs, while providing necessary isolation between services.
