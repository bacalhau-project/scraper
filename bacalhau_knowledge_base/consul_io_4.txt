Consul does offer integrations with many third-party API gateway products, but some customers may prefer a single solution that is directly integrated into their service mesh.SolutionConsul API Gateway to control access to servicesThe Consul API Gateway detects inbound requests to mesh-based applications, presents those clients with a verifiable certificate from a trusted authority, and facilitates the necessary secure connections to fulfill the requests. By combining the Consul API Gateway with Consul's service mesh, users gain a single control plane that makes it easier to consistently manage both east-west and north-south traffic.TutorialsExplore allTutorialControl service mesh access with Consul API Gateway on KubernetesIn this tutorial, you will go through the steps to install Consul, the Consul API Gateway, and an example application in a Kubernetes environment.TutorialControl service mesh access with Consul API Gateway on VMsThis tutorial uses HashiCups, a demo coffee shop application made up of several microservices running on VMs.Get started with HCP ConsulWe’ve built a series of step-by-step guides to help you deploy HCP Consul and try it for yourself.Try HCP Consul for freePlay videoIntroduction to HashiCorp ConsulHashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar gives a whiteboard overview of HashiCorp Consul, a service networking solution to connect, configure, and secure services in dynamic infrastructure.IntroGuidesDocsCommunityPrivacySecurityConsent ManagerManage cookiesHashiCorp uses data collected by cookies and JavaScript libraries to improve your browsing experience, analyze site traffic, and increase the overall performance of our site.
