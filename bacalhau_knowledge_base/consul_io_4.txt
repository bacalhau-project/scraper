Tutorial
Load balancing services in Consul service mesh with Envoy
This tutorial will guide you through the steps needed to change the load balancing policy for a service in your mesh.
Use case
Consul can help bypass manual processes by automating load balancer updates to reflect the latest changes to your services.
Challenge
In a modern environment where multiple replicas of a service exist, load balancers play an important role in ensuring the equal distribution of traffic to backend services. However, as services scale or change over time, load balancers require updates that are typically performed via manual processes which can affect the delivery time of a solution.
Solution
Consul helps load balancers automatically adapt to changes in services. Consul has a built-in load balancing feature that allows services to communicate directly with one another. Consul also integrates with many popular load balancers such as NGINX, HAProxy, and F5 to automatically provide service updates, eliminating the need for manual processes.
