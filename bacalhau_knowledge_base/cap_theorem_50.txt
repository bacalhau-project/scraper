For measurement in network science of graph structure, seeModularity (networks).Anetwork partitionis a division of a computer network into relatively independentsubnets, either by design, to optimize them separately, or due to the failure of network devices. Distributed software must be designed to be partition-tolerant, that is, even after the network is partitioned, it still works correctly.For example, in a network with multiple subnets where nodes A and B are located in one subnet and nodes C and D are in another, a partition occurs if thenetwork switchdevice between the two subnets fails. In that case nodes A and B can no longer communicate with nodes C and D, but all nodes A-D work the same as before.As a CAP trade-off[edit]TheCAP theoremis based on three trade-offs:consistency,availability, and partition tolerance. Partition tolerance, in this context, means the ability of a data processing system to continue processing data even if a network partition causes communication errors between subsystems.[1]External links[edit]Partition of the Large Networkdoi:10.13140/RG.2.2.20183.06565/6References[edit]^Stonebraker, Michael (April 5, 2010)."Errors in Database Systems, Eventual Consistency, and the CAP Theorem".
