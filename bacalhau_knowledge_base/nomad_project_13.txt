Vault Integration
Many workloads require access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and
other secrets. To enable secure, auditable and easy access to your secrets,
Nomad integrates with HashiCorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/). Nomad servers and clients
coordinate with Vault to derive a Vault token that has access to only the Vault
policies the tasks needs. Nomad clients make the token available to the task and
handle the tokens renewal.
Configuration
In order to use Vault with Nomad, you will need to configure and install Vault separately from Nomad. Nomad does not run Vault for you.
Agent Configuration
To enable Vault integration, Nomad agents must be configured with
[ vault](/nomad/docs/configuration/vault) blocks. Each block can be enabled or disabled and configures how
Nomad connects to the Vault cluster.
Dynamic Configuration with Secrets
Nomad's job specification includes a [ template](/nomad/docs/job-specification/template) block that uses a tool
called
[Consul Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template). When used with Vault, this mechanism creates a convenient way to ship configuration files that are populated from Vault secrets.
For more information on Nomad's template block please see the
[ template job specification documentation](/nomad/docs/job-specification/template#vault-integration).
Vault ACL
The Vault ACL system protects the cluster from unauthorized access. When enabled, both Vault and Nomad must be properly configured in order for their integrations to work.
Refer to the [Vault ACL integration page](/nomad/docs/integrations/vault/acl) for more information.
Multiple Vault Clusters Enterprise
Nomad Enterprise supports access to multiple Vault clusters. They can be
configured using multiple [ vault](/nomad/docs/configuration/vault) blocks with different
name
values. If a
name
is not provided, the cluster configuration is called default
.Jobs that need access to Vault may specify which Vault cluster to use with the
[ vault.cluster](/nomad/docs/job-specification/vault#cluster) parameter.
Compatibility
- Nomad versions 1.4.0 and above are compatible with any currently supported version of Vault.
