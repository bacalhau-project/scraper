CTS runs as a daemon and integrates the network topology maintained by your Consul cluster with your network infrastructure to dynamically secure and connect services.CTS workflowThe following diagram shows the CTS workflow as it monitors the Consul service catalog for updates.CTS monitors the state of Consul’s service catalog and its KV store. This process is described inWatcher and views.CTS detects a change.CTS prompts Terraform to update the state of the infrastructure.Watcher and viewsCTS uses Consul’sblocking queriesfunctionality to monitor Consul for updates. If an endpoint does not support blocking queries, CTS uses polling to watch for changes. These mechanisms are referred to in CTS aswatchers.The watcher maintains a separate thread for each value monitored and runs any tasks that depend on the watched value whenever it is updated. These threads are referred to asviews.  For example, a thread may run a task to update a proxy when the watcher detects that an instance has become unhealthy .TasksA task is the action triggered by the updated data monitored in Consul. It
takes that dynamic service data and translates it into a call to the
infrastructure application to configure it with the updates. It uses a driver
to push out these updates, the initial driver being a local Terraform run. An
example of a task is to automate a firewall security policy rule with
discovered IP addresses for a set of Consul services.DriversA driver encapsulates the resources required to communicate the updates to the
network infrastructure. The followingdriversare supported:Terraform driverHCP Terraform driverEnterpriseEnterpriseEach driver includes a set of providers thatenables supportfor a wide variety of infrastructure applications.State storage and persistenceThe following types of state information are associated with CTS.Terraform state informationBy default, CTS storesTerraform state datain the Consul KV, but you can specify where this information is stored by configuring thebackendsetting in theTerraform driver configuration. The data persists if CTS stops and the backend is configured to a remote location.CTS task and event dataBy default, CTS stores task and event data in memory. This data is transient and does not persist. If you configureCTS to run with high availability enabled, CTS stores the data in the Consul KV. High availability is an enterprise feature that promotes CTS resiliency. When high availability is enabled, CTS stores and persists task changes and events that occur when an instance stops.The data stored when operating in high availability mode includes task changes made using the task API or CLI. Examples of task changes include creating a new task, deleting a task, and enabling or disabling a task. You can empty the leader’s stored state information by starting CTS with the-reset-storageflag.Instance compatibility checks (high availability)If yourun CTS with high availability enabled, CTS performs instance compatibility checks to ensure that all instances in the cluster behave consistently. Consistent instance behavior enables CTS to properly perform automations configured in the state storage.The CTS instance compatibility check reports an error if the taskmoduleis configured with a local module, but the module does not exist on the CTS instance. Refer to theTerraform documentationfor additional information about module sources. Example log:[ERROR] ha.compat: error="compatibility check failure: stat ./example-module: no such file or directory"Refer toError Messagesfor additional information.CTS instances perform a compatibility check on start-up based on the stored state and every five minutes after starting. If the check detects an incompatible CTS instance, it generates a log so that an operator can address it.CTS logs the error message and continues to run when it finds an incompatibility. CTS can still elect an incompatible instance to be the leader, but tasks affected by the incompatibility do not run successfully. This can happen when all active CTS instances enteronce-modeand run the tasks once when initially elected.Security guidelinesWe recommend following the network security guidelines described in theSecure Consul-Terraform-Sync for Productiontutorial. The tutorial contains a checklist of best practices to secure your CTS installation for a production environment.Edit this page on GitHubOn this page:Consul-Terraform-Sync ArchitectureCTS workflowWatcher and viewsTasksDriversState storage and persistenceInstance compatibility checks (high availability)Security guidelinesThemeCertificationsSystem StatusCookie ManagerTerms of UseSecurityPrivacyTrademark PolicyTrade ControlsAccessibilityGive Feedback(opens in new tab)
