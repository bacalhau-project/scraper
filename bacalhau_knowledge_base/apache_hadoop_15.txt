component is a numeric value. Versions can also have additional suffixes
like"-alpha2"or"-beta1", which denote the API compatibility
guarantees and quality of the release. We use“a.b.c”and“x.y.z”to
denote a dotted version triplet.Major versions are used to introduce substantial, potentially
incompatible, changes. Examples of this include the replacement of
MapReduce 1 with YARN and MapReduce 2 in Hadoop 2, and the required Java
runtime version from JDK7 to JDK8 in Hadoop 3.Minor versions are used to introduce new compatible features within a
major release line.Maintenance releases include bug fixes or low-risk supportability
changes.Hadoop’s versioning scheme has evolved over the years. The early days of
0.20.2 leading up to the 1.y releases saw aplethora of parallel
releaseswith different featuresets. Release activities coalesced in the early
2.y release era, with a mostly linear progression of releases from 2.0.0
through 2.7.0.However, the ongoing maintenance of the 2.6.z and 2.7.z re-introduced
parallel active release lines to Hadoop. Additional plans for 2.8.z and
3.0.z releases mean potentially four active release lines, necessitating
clarification on Hadoop versioning and how it affects these parallel
release branches.Versioning rulesTo establish a common foundation of knowledge, we require the following
in terms of release versions.Fora.b.c(maintenance) releases, the “c"s need to be released
in order.Fora.b.0(minor) releases, the “b"s need to be released in
order.Fora.0.0(major) releases, it comes after a specific x.y.0
minor release.This means that new major releases need to be coordinated with the
previous minor release. New minor and maintenance releases only require
coordination within their release line."-alphaX”and"-betaX”suffixed version can be treated as a.b.c
versions, with the first (e.g."-alpha1") being the a.b.0 release.When it comes to setting fix versions, this policy is encoded by the
following set of rules:For eachminorrelease line, set thelowest unreleased a.b.c
version, where c â¥ 0.For eachmajorrelease line, set thelowest unreleased a.b.0
version.ExampleAs an example, as of August 3rd, 2016, the latest releases in the 2.6.x
and 2.7.x lines are 2.6.4 and 2.7.2. We have also cut the following
branches for planned future releases: branch-2.7.3, branch-2.8, and
branch-3.0.0-alpha1.If we are committing a bugfix that is intended for the 2.6.5 release, we
would commit to:trunk (3.0.0-alpha2)branch-3.0.0-alpha1 (3.0.0-alpha1)branch-2 (2.9.0)branch-2.8 (2.8.0)branch-2.7 (2.7.4)branch-2.7.3 (2.7.3)branch-2.6 (2.6.5)Applying the above rules for setting fix versions:Rule 1: 2.6.z and 2.7.z are both minor release lines, so set2.6.5and2.7.3Rule 2: 2.y.z and 3.y.z the major release lines, so set2.8.0and3.0.0-alpha1Note that when backporting changes, we always make sure to backport to
the next higher release in a release line. For instance, we make sure to
backport to branch-2.7 (2.7.4) when backporting to branch-2.7.3 (2.7.3),
and to branch-2 (2.9.0) when backporting to branch-2.8 (2.8.0). This
preserves the monotonicity of releases.Apache Hadoop, Hadoop, Apache, the Apache feather logo,
