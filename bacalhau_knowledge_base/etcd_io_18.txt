The original page was authored byBartłomiej Rutkowskiand others.Starting with version 0.1.2 both etcd and etcdctl have been ported to FreeBSD and can be installed either via packages or ports system. Their versions have been recently updated to 0.2.0 so now etcd and etcdctl can be enjoyed on FreeBSD 10.0 (RC4 as of now) and 9.x, where they have been tested. They might also work when installed from ports on earlier versions of FreeBSD, but it is untested; caveat emptor.InstallationUsing pkgng package systemIf pkg­ng is not installed, install it with commandpkgand answering ‘Y’ when asked.Update the repository data withpkg update.Install etcd withpkg install coreos-etcd coreos-etcdctl.Verify successful installation by confirmingpkg info | grep etcdmatches:r@fbsd­10:/ # pkg info | grep etcd
coreos­etcd­0.2.0              Highly­available key value store and service discovery
coreos­etcdctl­0.2.0           Simple commandline client for etcd
r@fbsd­10:/ #etcd and etcdctl are ready to use! For more information about using pkgng, please see:http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng­intro.htmlUsing ports systemIf ports is not installed, install withportsnap fetch extract(it may take some time depending on hardware and network connection).Build etcd withcd /usr/ports/devel/etcd && make install clean. There will be an option to build and install documentation and etcdctl with it.If etcd wasn’t installed with etcdctl, it can be built later withcd /usr/ports/devel/etcdctl && make install clean.Verify successful installation by confirmingpkg info | grep etcdmatches:r@fbsd­10:/ # pkg info | grep etcd
