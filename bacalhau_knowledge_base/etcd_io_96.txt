procedureVersionsv3.6-DRAFTUpgradingUpgrade etcd from 3.1 to 3.2Upgrade etcd from 3.1 to 3.2Processes, checklists, and notes on upgrading etcd from 3.1 to 3.2In the general case, upgrading from etcd 3.1 to 3.2 can be a zero-downtime, rolling upgrade:one by one, stop the etcd v3.1 processes and replace them with etcd v3.2 processesafter running all v3.2 processes, new features in v3.2 are available to the clusterBeforestarting an upgrade, read through the rest of this guide to prepare.Upgrade checklistsNOTE:Whenmigrating from v2 with no v3 data, etcd server v3.2+ panics when etcd restores from existing snapshots but no v3ETCD_DATA_DIR/member/snap/dbfile. This happens when the server had migrated from v2 with no previous v3 data. This also prevents accidental v3 data loss (e.g.dbfile might have been moved). etcd requires that post v3 migration can only happen with v3 data. Do not upgrade to newer v3 versions until v3.0 server contains v3 data.Highlighted breaking changes in 3.2.Changed defaultsnapshot-countvalueHigher--snapshot-countholds more Raft entries in memory until snapshot, thus causingrecurrent higher memory usage.

If it’s before 3.1, pleaseupgrade to 3.1before upgrading to 3.2.Also, to ensure a smooth rolling upgrade, the running cluster must be healthy. Check the health of the cluster by using theetcdctl endpoint healthcommand before proceeding.PreparationBefore upgrading etcd, always test the services relying on etcd in a staging environment before deploying the upgrade to the production environment.Before beginning,backup the etcd data. Should something go wrong with the upgrade, it is possible to use this backup todowngradeback to existing etcd version. Please note that thesnapshotcommand only backs up the v3 data. For v2 data, seebacking up v2 datastore.Mixed versionsWhile upgrading, an etcd cluster supports mixed versions of etcd members, and operates with the protocol of the lowest common version. The cluster is only considered upgraded once all of its members are upgraded to version 3.2. Internally, etcd members negotiate with each other to determine the overall cluster version, which controls the reported version and the supported features.LimitationsNote: If the cluster only has v3 data and no v2 data, it is not subject to this limitation.If the cluster is serving a v2 data set larger than 50MB, each newly upgraded member may take up to two minutes to catch up with the existing cluster. Check the size of a recent snapshot to estimate the total data size. In other words, it is safest to wait for 2 minutes between upgrading each member.For a much larger total data size, 100MB or more , this one-time process might take even more time. Administrators of very large etcd clusters of this magnitude can feel free to contact theetcd teambefore upgrading, and we’ll be happy to provide advice on the procedure.DowngradeIf all members have been upgraded to v3.2, the cluster will be upgraded to v3.2, and downgrade from this completed state isnot possible. If any single member is still v3.1, however, the cluster and its operations remains “v3.1”, and it is possible from this mixed cluster state to return to using a v3.1 etcd binary on all members.Pleasebackup the data directoryof all etcd members to make downgrading the cluster possible even after it has been completely upgraded.Upgrade procedureThis example shows how to upgrade a 3-member v3.1 etcd cluster running on a local machine.1. Check upgrade requirementsIs the cluster healthy and running v3.1.x?$ ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl endpoint health --endpoints=localhost:2379,localhost:22379,localhost:32379
