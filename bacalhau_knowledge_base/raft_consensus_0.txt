The Raft Consensus AlgorithmQuick LinksRaft paperraft-dev mailing listRaft implementationsWhat is Raft?Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's
equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that
it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly
addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope Raft will make
consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider audience will be
able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based systems than are
available today.Hold on—what is consensus?Consensus is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems.
Consensus involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a
decision on a value, that decision is final. Typical consensus algorithms make
progress when any majority of their servers is available; for example, a
cluster of 5 servers can continue to operate even if 2 servers fail.
If more servers fail, they stop making progress (but will never return an
incorrect result).Consensus typically arises in the context of replicated state machines, a
general approach to building fault-tolerant systems. Each server has a state
machine and a log. The state machine is the component that we want to make
fault-tolerant, such as a hash table. It will appear to clients that they are
interacting with a single, reliable state machine, even if a minority of the
servers in the cluster fail. Each state machine takes as input commands from
its log. In our hash table example, the log would include commands likeset
x to 3. A consensus algorithm is used to agree on the commands in the
servers' logs. The consensus algorithm must ensure that if any state machine
appliesset x to 3as thenthcommand, no other
state machine will ever apply a differentnthcommand. As a
result, each state machine processes the same series of commands and thus
produces the same series of results and arrives at the same series of states.Raft VisualizationHere's a Raft cluster running in your browser. You can interact with it to see
Raft in action. Five servers are shown on the left, and their logs are shown on
the right. We hope to create a screencast soon to explain what's going on. This
visualization (RaftScope)
is still pretty rough around the edges; pull requests would be very welcome.The Secret Lives of Datais a different visualization of Raft. It's more guided and less interactive, so
it may be a gentler starting point.PublicationsThis is "the Raft paper", which describes Raft in detail:In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)byDiego OngaroandJohn Ousterhout.
A slightly shorter version of this paper received a Best Paper Award at the2014 USENIX Annual Technical Conference.Diego Ongaro'sPh.D. dissertationexpands on the content of the paper in much more detail, and it includes a
simpler cluster membership change algorithm. The dissertation also includes a
formal specification of Raft written in TLA+; a slightly updated version of that
specification ishere.More Raft-related papers:Doug Woos,
