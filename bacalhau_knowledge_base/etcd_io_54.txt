Quickstart
Get etcd up and running in less than 5 minutes!
Follow these instructions to locally install, run, and test a single-member cluster of etcd:
Install etcd from pre-built binaries or from source. For details, see
[Install](../install/).Important: Ensure that you perform the last step of the installation instructions to verify thatetcd
is in your path.Launch
etcd
:$ etcd --logger=zap {"level":"info","ts":"2021-09-20T08:19:31.340-0400","caller":"etcdmain/etcd.go:110","msg":... } ⋮
Note: The output produced byetcd
are[logs](../op-guide/configuration/#logging-flags)— info-level logs can be ignored.From another terminal, use
etcdctl
to set a key:$ etcdctl put greeting "Hello, etcd" OK
From the same terminal, retrieve the key:
$ etcdctl get greeting greeting Hello, etcd
