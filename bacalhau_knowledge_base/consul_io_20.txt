You can deploy Consul
to Kubernetes using theHelm chartorConsul K8s CLI, sync services between Consul and
Kubernetes, run Consul Service Mesh, and more.
This section documents the official integrations between Consul and Kubernetes.Use CasesConsul Service Mesh:
Consul can automatically inject theConsul Service Meshsidecar into pods so that they can accept and establish encrypted
and authorized network connections with mutual TLS. And because Consul Service Mesh
can run anywhere, pods and external services can communicate with each other over a fully encrypted connection.Service sync to enable Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes services to communicate:
Consul can sync Kubernetes services with its own service registry. This service sync allows
Kubernetes services to use Kubernetes' native service discovery capabilities to discover
and connect to external services registered in Consul, and for external services
to use Consul service discovery to discover and connect to Kubernetes services.Additional integrations: Consul can run directly on Kubernetes, so in addition to the
native integrations provided by Consul itself, any other tool built for
Kubernetes can leverage Consul.Getting Started With Consul and KubernetesThere are several ways to try Consul with Kubernetes in different environments.TutorialsTheGetting Started with Consul Service Mesh trackprovides guidance for installing Consul as service mesh for Kubernetes using the Helm
chart, deploying services in the service mesh, and using intentions to secure service
communications.TheMigrate to Microservices with Consul Service Mesh on Kubernetescollection uses an example application written by a fictional company to illustrate why and how organizations can
migrate from monolith to microservices using Consul service mesh on Kubernetes. The case study in this collection
should provide information valuable for understanding how to develop services that leverage Consul during any stage
of your microservices journey.TheConsul and Minikube guideis a quick step-by-step guide for deploying Consul with the official Helm chart on a local instance of Minikube.Review production best practices and cloud-specific configurations for deploying Consul on managed Kubernetes runtimes.TheConsul on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) tutorialis a complete step-by-step guide on how to deploy Consul on AKS.
