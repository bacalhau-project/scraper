29 July 2024 - Josep Prat ([@jlprat](https://twitter.com/jlprat))
We are proud to announce the release of Apache Kafka 3.8.0. This release contains many new features and improvements. This blog post will highlight some of the more prominent features. For a full list of changes, be sure to check the [release notes](https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.8.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html).
See the [Upgrading to 3.8.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.7.x](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#upgrade_3_8_0) section in the documentation for the list of notable changes and detailed upgrade steps.
In a previous release, 3.6,
[tiered storage](https://kafka.apache.org/38/documentation.html#tiered_storage) was released as early access feature.
In this release, Tiered Storage now supports clusters configured with multiple log directories (i.e. JBOD feature). This feature still remains as early access.
In the last release, 3.7, [KIP-858](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-858%3A+Handle+JBOD+broker+disk+failure+in+KRaft)
was released in early access. Since this version, JBOD in KRaft is no longer considered an early access feature.
Up until now, only the default compression level was used by Apache Kafka. From this version on, a configuration mechanism to specify compression level is included. See [KIP-390](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-390%3A+Support+Compression+Level) for more details.
[KIP-848 The Next Generation of the Consumer Rebalance Protocol](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-848%3A+The+Next+Generation+of+the+Consumer+Rebalance+Protocol) is available as preview in 3.8. This version includes numerous bug
fixes and the community is encouraged to test and provide feedback. [See the preview release notes for more information.](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/The+Next+Generation+of+the+Consumer+Rebalance+Protocol+%28KIP-848%29+-+Preview+Release+Notes)
The configuration value offsets.commit.required.acks
is deprecated in this version and it will be removed in Kafka 4.0. See [KIP-1041](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=303794933) for more details.
Note: ZooKeeper is marked as deprecated since the 3.5.0 release. ZooKeeper is planned to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. For more information, please see the documentation for [ZooKeeper Deprecation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#zk_depr).

[KIP-989: Improved StateStore Iterator metrics for detecting leaks](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-989%3A+Improved+StateStore+Iterator+metrics+for+detecting+leaks):
This KIP introduces several new metrics to aid users in finding leaked Iterators, as well as identifying the cause of a high number of pinned blocks, or other kinds of memory leaks and performance problems.
[KIP-924: customizable task assignment for Streams](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-924%3A+customizable+task+assignment+for+Streams):
This KIP adds a new group of configurable interfaces for plugging custom behaviour into the Streams Partition Assignor. This configuration supplants the existing internal task assignor config. Additionally, it limits the scope of these configs to supplying a custom task assignor. This opens the door for future KIPs to add further configs in which a user can set to plug in custom behavior.
[KIP-813: Shareable State Stores](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-813%3A+Shareable+State+Stores):
This KIP adds Shareable State Stores, introducing the ability to use data within a state store across multiple applications without duplicating it on topic level.

27 February 2024 - Stanislav Kozlovski ([@BdKozlovski](https://twitter.com/BdKozlovski))
We are proud to announce the release of Apache Kafka 3.7.0. This release contains many new features and improvements. This blog post will highlight some of the more prominent features. For a full list of changes, be sure to check the [release notes](https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.7.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html).
See the [Upgrading to 3.7.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.6.x](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#upgrade_3_7_0) section in the documentation for the list of notable changes and detailed upgrade steps.
In the last release, 3.6,
[the ability to migrate Kafka clusters from a ZooKeeper metadata system](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#kraft_zk_migration)
to a KRaft metadata system was ready for usage in production environments with one caveat -- JBOD was not yet available for KRaft clusters.
In this release, we are shipping an early access release of JBOD in KRaft. (See [KIP-858](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-858%3A+Handle+JBOD+broker+disk+failure+in+KRaft) and the [release notes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+JBOD+in+KRaft+Early+Access+Release+Notes) for details).
Additionally, client APIs released prior to Apache Kafka 2.1 are now marked deprecated in 3.7 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. See [KIP-896](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-896%3A+Remove+old+client+protocol+API+versions+in+Kafka+4.0) for details and RPC versions that are now deprecated.
Java 11 support for the Kafka broker is also marked deprecated in 3.7, and is planned to be removed in Kafka 4.0. See [KIP-1013](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=284789510) for more details. Note that clients can continue to use JDK >= 11 to connect to Kafka brokers.
Note: ZooKeeper is marked as deprecated since the 3.5.0 release. ZooKeeper is planned to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. For more information, please see the documentation for [ZooKeeper Deprecation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#zk_depr).
Kafka Broker, Controller, Producer, Consumer and Admin Client
[(Early Access) KIP-858 Handle JBOD broker disk failure in KRaft](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-858%3A+Handle+JBOD+broker+disk+failure+in+KRaft):
This update closes the gap on one of the last major missing features in KRaft by adding JBOD support in KRaft-based clusters. Note that it is not yet recommended for use in production environments. Please refer to the [release notes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+JBOD+in+KRaft+Early+Access+Release+Notes) to help us test it and provide feedback at [KAFKA-16061](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16061).
[KIP-714 Client metrics and observability](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-714%3A+Client+metrics+and+observability):
With KIP-714, operators get better visibility into the clients connecting to their cluster with broker-side support of client-level metrics via a standardized telemetry interface.
[KIP-1000 List Client Metrics Configuration Resources](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1000%3A+List+Client+Metrics+Configuration+Resources):
KIP-1000 supports KIP-714 by introducing a way to create, read, update, and delete the client metrics configuration resources using the existing RPCs and the kafka-configs.sh tool.
[(Early Access) KIP-848 The Next Generation of the Consumer Rebalance Protocol](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-848%3A+The+Next+Generation+of+the+Consumer+Rebalance+Protocol):
The new simplified Consumer Rebalance Protocol moves complexity away from the consumer and into the Group Coordinator within the broker and completely revamps the protocol to be incremental in nature. It provides the same guarantee as the current protocol––but better and more efficient, including no longer relying on a global synchronization barrier. [See the early access release notes for more information.](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/The+Next+Generation+of+the+Consumer+Rebalance+Protocol+%28KIP-848%29+-+Early+Access+Release+Notes)
[KIP-951 Leader discovery optimisations for the client](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-951%3A+Leader+discovery+optimisations+for+the+client):
KIP-951 optimizes the time it takes for a client to discover the new leader of a partition, leading to reduced end-to-end latency of produce/fetch requests in the presence of leadership changes (broker restarts, partition reassignments, etc.).
[KIP-975 Docker Image for Apache Kafka](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-975%3A+Docker+Image+for+Apache+Kafka):
Introduces an official Apache Kafka Docker image, enabling quicker testing and deployment, as well as onboarding of developers.
[KIP-580 Exponential Backoff for Kafka Clients](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-580%3A+Exponential+Backoff+for+Kafka+Clients):
Changes the client’s retry backoff time used for retrying failed requests from a static one to an exponentially-increasing one. This should help reduce slow metadata convergence after broker failure due to overload.
[KIP-963 Additional metrics in Tiered Storage](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-963%3A+Additional+metrics+in+Tiered+Storage):
KIP-405 brought the early access of Tiered Storage, and with this update we’re introducing new metrics for the feature, allowing you to better monitor performance, troubleshoot, and prevent issues.
[KIP-979 Allow independently stop KRaft processes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-979%3A+Allow+independently+stop+KRaft+processes):
Adds a way to independently stop KRaft processes in cases where operators are running in combined mode (a controller and broker in the same node). Previously, you could only stop both. The command line for stopping Kafka nodes now includes a pair of optional and mutually exclusive parameters "[--process-role]" OR "[--node-id]" to use with ./bin/kafka-server-stop.sh.
[KIP-890 Transactions Server-Side Defense](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-890%3A+Transactions+Server-Side+Defense):
Another part of this KIP shipped, this time adding transaction verification preventing hanging transactions for consumer offset partitions.
[KIP-896 Remove old client protocol API versions in Kafka 4.0](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-896%3A+Remove+old+client+protocol+API+versions+in+Kafka+4.0):
KIP-896 marks all client request versions older than Apache Kafka 2.1 as deprecated, and introduces new metrics to monitor the presence of such requests. Support for these requests will be dropped in Apache Kafka 4.0.
[KIP-919 Allow AdminClient to Talk Directly with the KRaft Controller Quorum and add Controller Registration](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-919%3A+Allow+AdminClient+to+Talk+Directly+with+the+KRaft+Controller+Quorum+and+add+Controller+Registration):
Allows the AdminClient to talk directly with the KRaft Controller Quorum, which allows us to support operations like DESCRIBE_QUORUM and INCREMENTAL_ALTER_CONFIGS to dynamically change the log4j levels on a KRaft controller. This helps with debugging scenarios where other parts of the system are down.
[KIP-978 Allow dynamic reloading of certificates with different DN / SANs](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=263429128):
Allows configurability to prevent checks that ensure DN (Distinguished Name) and SAN (Subject Alternative Names) are the same between old and new keystores when they’re being reload. This ultimately allows dynamic reloading of certificates that have different DN/SANs.
[KIP-1001 Add CurrentControllerId Metric](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1001%3A+Add+CurrentControllerId+Metric):
Adds a CurrentControllerId metric, allowing users to find the current controller by looking at the metrics of any Kafka broker/controller.
[KIP-938 Add more metrics for measuring KRaft performance](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-938%3A+Add+more+metrics+for+measuring+KRaft+performance):
We’ve added 11 new metrics for measuring KRaft-mode performance, including ActiveControllersCount, CurrentMetadataVersion and TimedOutBrokerHeartbeatCount.
[KIP-1013 Drop broker and tools support for Java 11 in Kafka 4.0 (deprecate in 3.7)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=284789510):
Java 11 is now deprecated for all the server and tools modules - kafka-server-common, kafka-server, kafka_2.13, kafka-storage, kafka-metadata, kafka-group-coordinator, kafka-raft, kafka-shell, kafka-tools. It will not be supported after Kafka 4.0. All other modules (including clients, streams and connect) will continue to require Java 11 (as specified by [KIP-750](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=181308223)).
Kafka Streams
[KIP-925 Rack aware task assignment in Kafka Streams](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-925%3A+Rack+aware+task+assignment+in+Kafka+Streams):
In part one of KIP-925, the min_traffic assignment strategy for Kafka Streams was added. Part two finishes the KIP by introducing the second rack-aware assignment strategy: balanced_subtopology.
[KIP-954 Expand default DSL store configuration to custom types](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-954%3A+expand+default+DSL+store+configuration+to+custom+types):
KIP-954 builds on KIP-591 and allows users to provide a default state store provider for their custom stores. As part of this change, a new interface has been provided along with default support for RocksDB and in-memory state stores.
[KIP-962 Relax non-null key requirement in Kafka Streams](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-962%3A+Relax+non-null+key+requirement+in+Kafka+Streams):
Kafka Streams treated records with null-keys as invalid input for joins and dropped them on the floor. KIP-962 relaxes this behavior for various left-joins and thus allows null-key records to be processed successfully.
[KIP-988 Streams Standby Update Listener](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-988%3A+Streams+Standby+Update+Listener):
Adds a new interface for handling cases where standby tasks have their a) state stores registered, b) load a batch of records and c) stop updates.
[KIP-960](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-960%3A+Support+single-key_single-timestamp+interactive+queries+%28IQv2%29+for+versioned+state+stores) / [KIP-968](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-968%3A+Support+single-key_multi-timestamp+interactive+queries+%28IQv2%29+for+versioned+state+stores) IQ support for Versioned State Stores:
Version state stores were added in Apache Kafka 3.5 release (KIP-889), but it was not possible so far to query the new stores. KIP-960 and KIP-968 close this gap by adding new query types for IQv2 namely VersionedKeyQuery and MultiVersionedKeyQuery, respectively. Both queries allow you to do lookups for a single key, to ask for the most recent value, a historic value, or a range of historic values for the provided key.
[KIP-985 Add reverseRange and reverseAll query over kv-store in IQv2](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-985%3A+Add+reverseRange+and+reverseAll+query+over+kv-store+in+IQv2):
IQv2 supports RangeQueries which allow you to query for a range of keys. However, the API did not provide any guarantee about the ordering of the returned result. With KIP-985 it’s now possible to request the result to be ordered (per partition) in either ascending or descending order, or leave the order unspecified.
[KIP-992 Introduce IQv2 Query Types: TimestampedKeyQuery and TimestampedRangeQuery](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-992%3A+Proposal+to+introduce+IQv2+Query+Types%3A+TimestampedKeyQuery+and+TimestampedRangeQuery):
Finally, KIP-992 adds new timestamped-key and timestamped-range interactive queries for timestamped key-value state stores. This change improves the type safety of the IQv2 API. The existing RangeQuery now always returns only the value if issued against a timestamped key-value store.

We are proud to announce the release of Apache Kafka 3.6.0. This release contains many new features and improvements. This blog post will highlight some of the more prominent features. For a full list of changes, be sure to check the [release notes](https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/3.6.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html).
See the [Upgrading to 3.6.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.5.x](https://kafka.apache.org/36/documentation.html#upgrade_3_6_0) section in the documentation for the list of notable changes and detailed upgrade steps.
The 3.6.0 release marked the first production ready release for the migration of Kafka
clusters from a ZooKeeper metadata system to a KRaft metadata system. Users wanting to
perform this migration are advised to first upgrade to 3.6.2 or 3.7.1 to receive important
bug fixes.
See the ZooKeeper to KRaft migration
[operations documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#kraft_zk_migration) for
details. Note that support for JBOD is still not available for KRaft clusters, therefore clusters
utilizing JBOD can not be migrated. See [KIP-858](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-858%3A+Handle+JBOD+broker+disk+failure+in+KRaft)
for details regarding KRaft and JBOD.
Support for Delegation Tokens in KRaft ([KAFKA-15219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15219)) was completed in 3.6, further reducing the gap of features between ZooKeeper-based Kafka clusters and KRaft. Migration of delegation tokens from ZooKeeper to KRaft is also included in 3.6.
[Tiered Storage](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage) is an early access feature. It is currently only suitable for testing in non production environments. See the [Early Access Release Notes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Tiered+Storage+Early+Access+Release+Notes) for more details.
Note: ZooKeeper is marked as deprecated since 3.5.0 release. ZooKeeper is planned to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. For more information, please see the documentation for [ZooKeeper Deprecation](/documentation#zk_depr)
Kafka Broker, Controller, Producer, Consumer and Admin Client
[KIP-405](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage):
Kafka Tiered Storage (Early Access):
Introduces Tiered Storage to Kafka. Note that this
is an early access feature only advised for use in non-production environments (see the [early
access notes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Tiered+Storage+Early+Access+Release+Notes) for more information). This feature provides a separation of computation
and storage in the broker for pluggable storage tiering natively in Kafka Tiered Storage brings
a seamless extension of storage to remote objects with minimal operational changes.
[KIP-890](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-890%3A+Transactions+Server-Side+Defense):
Transactions Server Side Defense (Part 1):
Hanging transactions can negatively impact
your read committed consumers and prevent compacted logs from being compacted. KIP-890 helps
address hanging transactions by verifying partition additions. Part 2 of KIP-890 will optimize
verification, which currently adds an extra hop.
In 3.6.0, transaction verification will prevent hanging transactions on data partitions. In the next release, transactional offset commits will also be covered.
[KIP-797](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=195726330):
Accept duplicate listener on port for IPv4/IPv6:
Until now, Kafka has not supported
duplicate listeners on the same port. This works when using only a single IP stack, but presents
an issue if you are working with both IPv4 and IPv6. With KIP-797, brokers can be configured
with listeners that have the same port on different IP stacks. This update does not affect
advertised listeners, which already have this feature.
[KIP-863](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=225152035):
Reduce CompletedFetch#parseRecord() memory copy:
Reduces memory allocation and improves
memory performance during record deserialization by using a ByteBuffer instead of byte[] for
deserialization, which improves efficiency. Updated public interfaces include the Deserializer
class, ByteBufferDeserializer class, and StringDeserializer class.
[KIP-868](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-868+Metadata+Transactions):
Metadata Transactions:
Improves the overall durability of the KRaft layer by adding
metadata transactions that consist of:
- BeginTransaction
- Number of records
- EndTransaction or AbortTransaction
KRaft uses record batches as a mechanism for atomicity. Typically, there was a limit to the
fetch size on the Raft consensus layer, and the controller could generate a set of atomic
records that exceeded this limit. This update introduces marker records that allow larger sets
of atomic records to be sent to the Raft consensus layer in multiple batches. This bypasses the
fetch limit.
[KIP-902](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-902%3A+Upgrade+Zookeeper+to+3.8.2):
Upgrade Zookeeper to 3.8.2:
This upgrades the ZooKeeper version that is bundled with Kafka to
version 3.8.2. The new version includes several updates and security improvements.
[KIP-917](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-917%3A+Additional+custom+metadata+for+remote+log+segment):
Additional custom metadata for remote log segment:
It introduces having an optional
custom metadata as part of remote log segment metadata. RemoteStorageManager returns the
optional custom metadata when copyLogSegmentData() is invoked. It will be passed along with
remote log segment metadata.
[KIP-937](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-937%3A+Improve+Message+Timestamp+Validation):
Improve Message Timestamp Validation:
It improves data integrity and prevents potential
pitfalls caused by inaccurate timestamp handling by adding more validation logic for message
timestamps. While past timestamps are a normal occurrence in Kafka, future timestamps might
represent an incorrectly formatted integer. KIP-937 rejects messages with future timestamps and
provides a descriptive exemption.
[KIP-938](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-938%3A+Add+more+metrics+for+measuring+KRaft+performance):
Add more metrics for measuring KRaft performance:
Adds new controller, loader, and snapshot emitter KRaft performance metrics.
Kafka Streams
[KIP-923](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-923%3A+Add+A+Grace+Period+to+Stream+Table+Join): Add A Grace Period to Stream Table Join:
Adds a grace period to stream-table joins to improve table-side out-of-order data handling. The joined object has a new method called "withGracePeriod" that will cause the table side lookup to only happen after the grace period has passed.
[KIP-941](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-941%3A+Range+queries+to+accept+null+lower+and+upper+bounds): Range queries to accept null lower and upper bounds:
Previously, RangeQuery did not support null to specify “no upper/lower bound”.
KIP-941 allows users to pass null into withRange(...) for lower/upper bounds to specify a full or half-open range:
- `withRange(null, null)` == `withNoBounds()`
- `withRange(lower, null)` == `withLowerBound(lower)`
- `withRange(null, upper)` == `withUpperBound(upper)`
Kafka Connect
[KIP-793](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-793%3A+Allow+sink+connectors+to+be+used+with+topic-mutating+SMTs): Allow sink connectors to be used with topic-mutating SMTs:
Adds support for topic-mutating SMTs for async sink connectors. This is to address an incompatibility between sink connectors overriding the SinkTask::preCommit method and SMTs that mutate the topic field of a SinkRecord .
[KIP-875](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-875%3A+First-class+offsets+support+in+Kafka+Connect): First-class offsets support in Kafka Connect:
Provides first-class admin support for offsets in Kafka Connect. KIP-875 Part 1 added endpoints to get offsets and a new STOPPED state for connectors. The alter offsets and reset offsets endpoints have now been added.
Action |
Description |
GET /connectors/{connector}/offsets |
Retrieve the offsets for a connector; the connector must exist |
PATCH /connectors/{connector}/offsets |
Alter the offsets for a connector; the connector must exist, and must be in the STOPPED state
|
DELETE /connectors/{connector}/offsets |
Reset the offsets for a connector; the connector must exist, and must be in the STOPPED state
|
PUT /connectors/{connector}/pause |
Pause the connector; the connector must exist |
[KIP-898](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-898%3A+Modernize+Connect+plugin+discovery): Modernize Connect plugin discovery:
With KIP-898, Connect workers can now read from ServiceLoader manifests and module info directly during startup for more efficient plugin class discovery. Note that this update allows connector developers to add service declarations to their plugins.
