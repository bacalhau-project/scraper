Consul enforces zero trust by using identity-based access to ensure all communication within the service mesh is authenticated with TLS certificates and encrypted in transit.ChallengeSecurity within networkIn traditional security strategies, protection was primarily focused on the perimeter of a network. In cloud environments, the surface area for network access is much wider than the traditional on-premises networks. In addition, traditional security practices overlook the fact that many bad actors can originate from within the network walls. Zero trust security practices are now required to ensure both external and internal communications are authenticated and encrypted.SolutionSecurity and governanceConsul enforces zero trust security between all services within the service mesh. Consul supports a built-in certificate authority (CA), Vault, and AWS PCA to automatically generate and rotate TLS certificates used to authenticate and encrypt communication. This helps to increase the adoption of a zero trust security model. Consul's service intentions provide control to developers to ensure only the specified services are allowed to communicate. Consul also supports Vault to centralize certificate and secrets management.Customer case studyTide's self-service service mesh with HCP ConsulLearn how Tide abandoned its adoption of AWS AppMesh in favor of HashiCorp Consul, making the transition in only 6 weeks with no downtime and no big-bang migration.Read moreTutorialsExplore allTutorialSecure Consul agent communication with TLS encryptionThis tutorial will provide you with a production-ready TLS configuration for RPC and consensus communication.TutorialGenerate mTLS certificates for Consul with VaultLearn how to secure your Consul datacenter with mTLS using Vault's PKI secrets engine to create both a root and intermediate CA.TutorialVault as Consul service mesh certification authorityLearn how to configure your Consul datacenter to use Vault as the service mesh CA for new and existing datacenters.DocsExplore allDocumentationConsul encryptionThe Consul agent supports encrypting all of its network traffic.
