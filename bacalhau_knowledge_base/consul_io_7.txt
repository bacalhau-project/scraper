Tutorial
Deploy Consul on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Deploy a Consul datacenter on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with the official Helm chart.
Use case
Use Consul service mesh to securely connect applications on any runtime, any cloud, or on-premises environments.
Challenge
Multi-cloud is a core strategy and a natural progression as customers migrate to the public cloud. Customers are moving many applications to the cloud while keeping others on-premises. Customers are also adopting microservices, many of which need to communicate with existing legacy services. This is a common scenario where customers now struggle to manage and connect their services in a consistent manner across different clouds, platforms, runtimes, and networks.
Solution
Deploy in any public cloud or on-premises environment and on any deployment type, including VMs, Kubernetes, or Nomad. This consistent dataplane allows developers to connect their services between heterogeneous environments regardless of whether they are running on VMs in an on-premises datacenter or on a managed Kubernetes service like EKS, AKS, or GKE.
Consul supports true multi-tenancy with administrative partitions. Multiple deployments can remain under a single control plane, allowing for consistent management and governance while maintaining autonomy and isolation for different tenants. Operators can choose to self-manage their own Consul deployments or opt for a fully managed solution with HCP for Consul.

Deploy a Consul datacenter to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with HashiCorpâ€™s official Helm chart.
Tutorial
Provision and configure Consul federation with mesh gateways across the Azure and AWS. Then deploy microservices across the two clusters.
Documentation
Consul has many integrations with Kubernetes. This section documents the official integrations between Consul and Kubernetes.
Documentation
Use Consul service mesh in ECS networks to secure communication between ECS tasks and communication between tasks and external services.
Documentation
Nomad can take advantage of Consul service discovery or service mesh, or both. Consul documention provides detailed integration information.
