During a network outage, such applications may stall or infinitely wait for an answer packet, permanently consuming memory or other resources. When the failed network becomes available, those applications may also fail to retry any stalled operations or require a (manual) restart.Ignorance of network latency, and of thepacket lossit can cause, induces application- and transport-layer developers to allow unbounded traffic, greatly increasing dropped packets and wasting bandwidth.Ignorance of bandwidth limits on the part of traffic senders can result in bottlenecks.Complacency regarding network security results in being blindsided by malicious users and programs that continually adapt to security measures.Changes innetwork topologycan have effects on both bandwidth and latency issues, and therefore can have similar problems.Multiple administrators, as withsubnetsfor rival companies, may institute conflicting policies of which senders of network traffic must be aware in order to complete their desired paths.The "hidden" costs of building and maintaining a network or subnet are non-negligible and must consequently be noted in budgets to avoid vast shortfalls.If a system assumes a homogeneous network, then it can lead to the same problems that result from the first three fallacies.History[edit]The list of fallacies originated atSun Microsystems.L. Peter Deutsch, one of the original Sun "Fellows", first created a list of seven fallacies in 1994; incorporating four fallaciesBill Joyand Dave Lyon had already identified in "The Fallacies of Networked Computing".[2]Around 1997,James Gosling, another Sun Fellow and the inventor ofJava, added the eighth fallacy.[2]In an episode of "Software Engineering Radio"[3]Peter Deutsch added a ninth fallacy: "It's really an expansion of number 4. It extends beyond the boundaries of the physical network. ... The party you are communicating with is trustworthy."See also[edit]CAP theoremPACELC theoremDistributed computingFinevscoarse grained SOAReferences[edit]^Wilson, Gareth (2015-02-06)."The Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing - Tech Talk".
