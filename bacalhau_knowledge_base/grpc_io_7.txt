Welcome to our active community of developers who are using and enhancing gRPC, and building valuable integrations of gRPC with other software systems.
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)in all interactions.
Stay informed
Be the first to know! Follow these active channels for timely gRPC announcements:
Join the conversation
The [grpc-io](https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io) forum, mentioned above, is a great place to ask technical
questions and engage in discussions with other gRPC developers.
The following channels, though less actively monitored, are also good places to exchange with developers and find answers to your gRPC questions:
Community meetings
Get fresh news, and come talk with gRPC developers and other community members at one of our regular online community meetings.
Consult the [gRPC Community Meeting Working Doc](https://bit.ly/grpcmeetings) for meeting details.
Missed a meeting? No problem. Visit the [gRPC channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnk1HWelWnYtF78YZX80fg) for meeting videos.
Contribute
gRPC code and documentation
Interested in contributing to gRPC code or documentation found under the
[grpc](https://github.com/grpc) GitHub organization? To learn how, read
[grpc-community/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the CONTRIBUTING.md
page of the repo
that you’d like to contribute to.
gRPC Ecosystem
The [gRPC Ecosystem](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem) is a GitHub organization that hosts community projects
related to gRPC — projects include, but are not limited to, gRPC
extensions or integrations, as well as examples that demonstrate how to use gRPC
for common or technically challenging use cases.
Do you have a gRPC-related project that’s a good candidate for the ecosystem?
Submit a request to have your project added; for details, see [gRPC Ecosystem -
New projects are welcome!](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/main/grpc_ecosystem.md).
