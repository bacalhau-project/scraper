Node Onboarding
Introduction
This tutorial describes how to add new nodes to an existing private network. Two basic scenarios will be covered:
Adding a
[physical host/virtual](/setting-up/running-node/quick-start-docker#add-host-virtual-machine-as-a-new-node)machine as a new node.Adding a
[cloud instance](/setting-up/running-node/quick-start-docker#add-a-cloud-instance-as-a-new-node)as a new node.
Pre-Prerequisites
You should have an established private network consisting of at least one requester node. See the
[Create Private Network](/getting-started/create-private-network)guide to set one up.You should have a new host (physical/virtual machine, cloud instance or docker container) with
[Bacalhau](/getting-started/installation)installed.
Add Host/Virtual Machine as a New Node
Let's assume that you already have a private network with at least one requester node. In this case, the process of adding new nodes follows the [Create And Connect Compute Node](/getting-started/create-private-network#create-and-connect-compute-node) section. You will need to:
Set the token in the
node.network.authsecret
parameterExecute
bacalhau serve
specifying thenode type
andorchestrator
address via flags. You can find an example of such a command in the logs of the requester node, here is how it might look like:
Remember that in this example you need to replace all 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0.0 addresses with the actual public IP address of your node.
Add a Cloud Instance as a New Node
Let's assume you already have all the necessary cloud infrastructure set up with a private network with at least one requester node. In this case, you can add new nodes manually ([AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html), [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-images/create-instance-from-machine-image)) or use a tool like [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials) to automatically create and add any number of nodes to your network. The process of adding new nodes manually follows the [Create And Connect Compute Node](/getting-started/create-private-network#create-and-connect-compute-node) section.
To automate the process using Terraform follow these steps:
Configure terraform for
[your cloud provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)Determine the IP address of your requester node
Write a terraform script, which does the following:
Adds a new instance
Installs
bacalhau
on itLaunches a compute node
Execute the script
