If you instead have thenodejsexecutable on Debian, you should install thenodejs-legacypackage.Note:If you installednodevia a package manager and the version is still less than4.0, try directly installing it fromnodejs.org.INSTALLATIONInstall the gRPC NPM packagenpm install grpcBUILD FROM SOURCEThe following command can be used to build from source when installing the package from npm:npm install grpc --build-from-sourceThe--build-from-sourceoption will work even when installing another package that depends ongrpc. To build onlygrpcfrom source, you can use the argument--build-from-source=grpc.ABOUT ELECTRONThe official electron documentation recommends tobuild all of your native packages from source. While the reasons behind this are technically good - many native extensions won't be packaged to work properly with electron - the gRPC source code is fairly difficult to build from source due to its complex nature, and we're also providing working electron pre-built binaries. Therefore, we recommend that you do not follow this model for using gRPC with electron. Also, for the same reason,electron-rebuildwill always build from source. We advise you to not use this tool if you are depending on gRPC. Please note that there's not just one way to get native extensions running in electron, and that there's never any silver bullet for anything. The following instructions try to cater about some of the most generic ways, but different edge cases might require different methodologies.The best to get gRPC to work with electron is to do this, possibly in yourpostinstallscript of yourpackage.jsonfile:npm rebuild --target=2.0.0 --runtime=electron --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/electronNote that the2.0.0above is the electron runtime version number. You will need to update this every time you go on a different version of the runtime.If you have more native dependencies than gRPC, and they work better when built from source, you can explicitely specify which extension to build the following way:npm rebuild --build-from-source=sqlite3 --target=2.0.0 --runtime=electron --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/electronThis way, if you depend on bothgrpcandsqlite3, only thesqlite3package will be rebuilt from source, leaving thegrpcpackage to use its precompiled binaries.BUILD IN GIT REPOSITORYClonethe grpc-node Git Repository.Rungit submodule update --init --recursivefrom the repository root.Runcd packages/grpc-native-core.Runnpm install --build-from-source.Note:On Windows, this might fail due tonodejs issue #4932in which case, you will see something like the following innpm install's output (towards the very beginning):..
