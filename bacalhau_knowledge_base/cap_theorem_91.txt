It is developed at theAllen Institute for AIand was publicly released in November 2015.[2]Semantic Scholar uses modern techniques innatural language processingto support the research process, for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers.[3]The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence innatural language processing,machine learning,human–computer interaction, andinformation retrieval.[4]Semantic Scholar began as a database for the topics ofcomputer science,geoscience, andneuroscience.[5]In 2017, the system began includingbiomedical literaturein its corpus.[5]As of September 2022[update], it includes over 200 million publications from all fields of science.[6]Technology[edit]Semantic Scholar provides a one-sentence summary ofscientific literature. One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices.[7]It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers, since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read.[8]Artificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper, generating it through an "abstractive" technique.[3]The project uses a combination ofmachine learning,natural language processing, andmachine visionto add a layer ofsemantic analysisto the traditional methods ofcitation analysis, and to extract relevant figures,tables, entities, and venues from papers.[9][10]Another key AI-powered feature is Research Feeds, an adaptive research recommender that uses AI to quickly learn what papers users care about reading and recommends the latest research to help scholars stay up to date. It uses a state-of-the-art paper embedding model trained using contrastive learning to find papers similar to those in each Library folder.[11]Semantic Scholar also offers Semantic Reader, an augmented reader with the potential to revolutionize scientific reading by making it more accessible and richly contextual.[12]Semantic Reader provides in-line citation cards that allow users to see citations with TLDR summaries as they read and skimming highlights that capture key points of a paper so users can digest faster.In contrast withGoogle ScholarandPubMed, Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper.[13]The AI technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics.[14]Like the previously cited search engines, Semantic Scholar also exploits graph structures, which include theMicrosoft Academic Knowledge Graph, Springer Nature'sSciGraph, and the Semantic Scholar Corpus (originally a 45 million papers corpus in computer science, neuroscience and biomedicine).[15][16]Article identifier[edit]Each paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a uniqueidentifiercalled the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID (abbreviated S2CID). The following entry is an example:Liu, Ying; Gayle, Albert A; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Rocklöv, Joacim (March 2020).
