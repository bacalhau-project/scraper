Apache Hadoop
The Apache® Hadoop® project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
This is the first release of Apache Hadoop 3.4 line. It contains 2888 bug fixes, improvements and enhancements since 3.3.

CycloneDX Maven plugin. For more information on SBOM, please go to
[SBOM](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/SBOM).
HDFS Router-Router Based Federation now supports storing delegation tokens on MySQL,
[HADOOP-18535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18535)
which improves token operation through over the original Zookeeper-based implementation.
[HADOOP-18671](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18671) moved a number of
HDFS-specific APIs to Hadoop Common to make it possible for certain applications that
depend on HDFS semantics to run on other Hadoop compatible file systems.
In particular, recoverLease() and isFileClosed() are exposed through LeaseRecoverable interface, while setSafeMode() is exposed through SafeMode interface.
