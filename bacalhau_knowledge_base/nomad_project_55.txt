file. The driver requires the Jar file to be accessible from the Nomad
client via theartifactdownloader.Task Configurationtask"webservice"{driver="java"config{jar_path="local/example.jar"jvm_options=["-Xmx2048m","-Xms256m"]}}Thejavadriver supports the following configuration in the job spec:class- (Optional) The name of the class to run. Ifjar_pathis specified
and the manifest specifies a main class, this is optional. If shipping classes
rather than a Jar, please specify the class to run and theclass_path.class_path- (Optional) Theclass_pathspecifies the class path used by
Java to lookup classes and Jars.jar_path- (Optional) The path to the downloaded Jar. In most cases this will just be
the name of the Jar. However, if the supplied artifact is an archive that
contains the Jar in a subfolder, the path will need to be the relative path
(subdir/from_archive/my.jar).args- (Optional) A list of arguments to the Jar's main method. References
to environment variables or anyinterpretable Nomad
variableswill be interpreted before
launching the task.jvm_options- (Optional) A list of JVM options to be passed while invoking
java. These options are passed without being validated in any way by Nomad.pid_mode- (Optional) Set to"private"to enable PID namespace isolation for
this task, or"host"to disable isolation. If left unset, the behavior is
determined from thedefault_pid_modein plugin configuration.Warning:If set to"host", other processes running as the same user will
be able to access sensitive process information like environment variables.ipc_mode- (Optional) Set to"private"to enable IPC namespace isolation for
this task, or"host"to disable isolation. If left unset, the behavior is
determined from thedefault_ipc_modein plugin configuration.Warning:If set to"host", other processes running as the same user will be
able to make use of IPC features, like sending unexpected POSIX signals.cap_add- (Optional) A list of Linux capabilities to enable for the task.
Effective capabilities (computed fromcap_addandcap_drop) must be a
subset of the allowed capabilities configured withallow_caps.
Note that"all"is not permitted here if theallow_capsfield in the
driver configuration doesn't also allow all capabilities.config{cap_add=["net_raw","sys_time"]}cap_drop- (Optional) A list of Linux capabilities to disable for the task.

Set to"private"to enable PID namespace isolation for tasks by default, or"host"to
disable isolation.Warning:If set to"host", other processes running as the same user will
be able to access sensitive process information like environment variables.default_ipc_mode(string: optional)- Defaults to"private". Set to"private"to enable IPC namespace isolation for tasks by default,
or"host"to disable isolation.Warning:If set to"host", other processes running as the same user will be
able to make use of IPC features, like sending unexpected POSIX signals.allow_caps- A list of allowed Linux capabilities. Defaults to["audit_write","chown","dac_override","fowner","fsetid","kill","mknod","net_bind_service","setfcap","setgid","setpcap","setuid","sys_chroot"]which is modeled after the capabilities allowed bydocker by default(withoutNET_RAW). Allows the operator to control which capabilities
can be obtained by tasks usingcap_addandcap_dropoptions.
Supports the value"all"as a shortcut for allow-listing all capabilities supported
by the operating system.Warning:Allowing more capabilities beyond the default may lead to
undesirable consequences, including untrusted tasks being able to compromise the
host system.Client RequirementsThejavadriver requires Java to be installed and in your system's$PATH. On
Linux, Nomad must run as root since it will usechrootandcgroupswhich
require root privileges. The task must also specify at least one artifact to
download, as this is the only way to retrieve the Jar being run.Client AttributesThejavadriver will set the following client attributes:driver.java- Set to1if Java is found on the host node. Nomad determines
this by executingjava -versionon the host and parsing the outputdriver.java.version- Version of Java, ex:1.6.0_65driver.java.runtime- Runtime version, ex:Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-466.1-11M4716)driver.java.vm- Virtual Machine information, ex:Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-466.1, mixed mode)Here is an example of using these properties in a job file:job"docs"{# Only run this job where the JVM is higher than version 1.6.0.constraint{attribute="${attr.driver.java.version}"operator=">"value="1.6.0"}}Resource IsolationThe resource isolation provided varies by the operating system of
the client and the configuration.On Linux, Nomad will attempt to use cgroups, namespaces, and chroot
to isolate the resources of a process. If the Nomad agent is not
running as root, many of these mechanisms cannot be used.As a baseline, the Java jars will be run inside a Java Virtual Machine,
providing a minimum amount of isolation.Nomad can only use cgroups to control resources if all the required controllers
are available. If one or more required cgroups are unavailable, Nomad will
disable resource controls that require cgroups entirely. See the documentation
oncgroup controller requirementsfor more details.ChrootThe chroot created on Linux is populated with data in the following
directories from the host machine:["/bin","/etc","/lib","/lib32","/lib64","/run/resolvconf","/sbin","/usr",]The task's chroot is populated by linking or copying the data from the host into
the chroot. Note that this can take considerable disk space. Since Nomad v0.5.3,
the client manages garbage collection locally which mitigates any issue this may
create.This list is configurable through the agent clientconfiguration file.Edit this page on GitHubOn this page:Java DriverTask ConfigurationExamplesCapabilitiesPlugin OptionsClient RequirementsClient AttributesResource IsolationThemeCertificationsSystem StatusCookie ManagerTerms of UseSecurityPrivacyTrademark PolicyTrade ControlsAccessibilityGive Feedback(opens in new tab)
