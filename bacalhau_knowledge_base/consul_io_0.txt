How do I secure the communication between them? How do I automate routine networking tasks? How do I control access to my environments?Discover servicesCreate a central registry that tracks services, updates, and health statuses in real time.Secure networkingEnsure all service-to-service communication is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.Automate networkingReduce the operator burden by automating key networking tasks.Access servicesControl access to services at the point of entry and centralize traffic management.Consul on KubernetesA robust service mesh for discovering and securely connecting applications on KubernetesLearn morePlay videoIntroduction to HashiCorp ConsulHashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar gives a whiteboard overview of HashiCorp Consul, a service networking solution to connect, configure, and secure services in dynamic infrastructure.Common use cases for ConsulDiscover services with DNS or HTTPUse DNS or an HTTP API to discover registered services and their locations with Consul.Control access to servicesControl access to services running within a Consul service mesh with the API Gateway.Dynamic load balancingAutomate manual networking tasks and reduce ticket queues as a bonus.Automated networking tasksProvision apps faster.
