This page provides an overview of the major changes.ARM SupportThis is the first release to support ARM architectures.Upgrade protobuf from 2.5.0 to something newerProtobuf upgraded to 3.7.1 as protobuf-2.5.0 reached EOL.Java 11 runtime supportJava 11 runtime support is completed.Shaded Guava from thirdpartyHadoop now switches to use a shaded version of Guava fromhadoop-thirdpartywhich helps to remove Guava version conflicts with downstream applications.Adoption of lz4-java and snappy-javaFor LZ4 and Snappy compression codec, Hadoop now moves to uselz4-javaandsnappy-javainstead of requring the native libraries of these to be installed on the systems running Hadoop.Support impersonation for AuthenticationFilterExternal services or YARN service may need to call into WebHDFS or YARN REST API on behave of the user using web protocols. It would be good to support impersonation mechanism in AuthenticationFilter or similar extensions.s3A EnhancementsLots of enhancements to the S3A code including Delegation Token support, better handling of 404 caching, S3guard performance, resilience improvementsABFS EnhancementsAddress issues which surface in the field and tune things which need tuning, add more tests where appropriate. Improve docs, especially troubleshooting.HDFS RBF stabilizationHDFS Router now supports security. Also contains many bug fixes and improvements.Support non-volatile storage class memory(SCM) in HDFS cache directives	.Aims to enable storage class memory first in read cache. Although storage class memory has non-volatile characteristics, to keep the same behavior as current read only cache, we don’t use its persistent characteristics currently.Application Catalog for YARN applications.application catalog system which provides an editorial and search interface for YARN applications. This improves usability of YARN for manage the life cycle of applications.Incorporate Tencent Cloud COS File System ImplementationTencent cloud is top 2 cloud vendors in China market and the object store COS is widely used among China’s cloud users. This task implements a COSN filesytem to support Tencent cloud COS natively in Hadoop.Scheduling of opportunistic containersscheduling of opportunistic container through the central RM (YARN-5220), through distributed scheduling (YARN-2877), as well as the scheduling of containers based on actual node utilization (YARN-1011) and the container promotion/demotion (YARN-5085).Getting StartedThe Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using Hadoop. Begin with theSingle Node Setupwhich shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation. Then move on to theCluster Setupto learn how to set up a multi-node Hadoop installation.©            2008-2022
