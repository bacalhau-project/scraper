Moreover, many authors qualify astheoremsonly the most important results, and use the termslemma,propositionandcorollaryfor less important theorems.Inmathematical logic, the concepts of theorems and proofs have beenformalizedin order to allow mathematical reasoning about them. In this context, statements becomewell-formed formulasof someformal language. Atheoryconsists of some basis statements calledaxioms, and somededucing rules(sometimes included in the axioms). The theorems of the theory are the statements that can be derived from the axioms by using the deducing rules.[c]This formalization led toproof theory, which allows proving general theorems about theorems and proofs. In particular,Gödel's incompleteness theoremsshow that everyconsistenttheory containing the natural numbers has true statements on natural numbers that are not theorems of the theory (that is they cannot be proved inside the theory).As the axioms are often abstractions of properties of thephysical world, theorems may be considered as expressing some truth, but in contrast to the notion of ascientific law, which isexperimental, the justification of the truth of a theorem is purelydeductive.[6][7]Aconjectureis a tentative proposition that may evolve to become a theorem if proven true.Theoremhood and truth[edit]Until the end of the 19th century and thefoundational crisis of mathematics, all mathematical theories were built from a few basic properties that were considered as self-evident; for example, the facts that everynatural numberhas a successor, and that there is exactly onelinethat passes through two given distinct points. These basic properties that were considered as absolutely evident were calledpostulatesoraxioms; for exampleEuclid's postulates. All theorems were proved by using implicitly or explicitly these basic properties, and, because of the evidence of these basic properties, a proved theorem was considered as a definitive truth, unless there was an error in the proof. For example, the sum of theinterior anglesof atriangleequals 180°, and this was considered as an undoubtable fact.One aspect of the foundational crisis of mathematics was the discovery ofnon-Euclidean geometriesthat do not lead to any contradiction, although, in such geometries, the sum of the angles of a triangle is different from 180°. So, the property"the sum of the angles of a triangle equals 180°"is either true or false, depending whether Euclid's fifth postulate is assumed or denied. Similarly, the use of "evident" basic properties ofsetsleads to the contradiction ofRussell's paradox. This has been resolved by elaborating the rules that are allowed for manipulating sets.This crisis has been resolved by revisiting the foundations of mathematics to make them morerigorous. In these new foundations, a theorem is awell-formed formulaof amathematical theorythat can be proved from theaxiomsandinference rulesof the theory. So, the above theorem on the sum of the angles of a triangle becomes:Under the axioms and inference rules ofEuclidean geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180°. Similarly, Russell's paradox disappears because, in an axiomatized set theory, theset of all setscannot be expressed with a well-formed formula. More precisely, if the set of all sets can be expressed with a well-formed formula, this implies that the theory isinconsistent, and every well-formed assertion, as well as its negation, is a theorem.In this context, the validity of a theorem depends only on the correctness of its proof. It is independent from the truth, or even the significance of the axioms. This does not mean that the significance of the axioms is uninteresting, but only that the validity of a theorem is independent from the significance of the axioms. This independence may be useful by allowing the use of results of some area of mathematics in apparently unrelated areas.An important consequence of this way of thinking about mathematics is that it allows defining mathematical theories and theorems asmathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. Examples areGödel's incompleteness theorems. In particular, there are well-formed assertions than can be proved to not be a theorem of the ambient theory, although they can be proved in a wider theory. An example isGoodstein's theorem, which can be stated inPeano arithmetic, but is proved to be not provable in Peano arithmetic. However, it is provable in some more general theories, such asZermelo–Fraenkel set theory.Epistemological considerations[edit]Many mathematical theorems are conditional statements, whose proofs deduce conclusions from conditions known ashypothesesorpremises. In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as anecessary consequenceof the hypotheses. Namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true—without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could also be interpreted differently in certaindeductive systems, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol (e.g.,non-classical logic).Although theorems can be written in a completely symbolic form (e.g., as propositions inpropositional calculus), they are often expressed informally in a natural language such as English for better readability. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed.In addition to the better readability, informal arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some waywhyit is obviously true. In some cases, one might even be able to substantiate a theorem by using a picture as its proof.Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to itsaesthetics. Theorems are often described as being "trivial", or "difficult", or "deep", or even "beautiful". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time and culture: for example, as a proof is obtained, simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial.[8]On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics.Fermat's Last Theoremis a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.[9]Informal account of theorems[edit]Logically, many theorems are of the form of anindicative conditional:If A, then B. Such a theorem does not assertB— only thatBis a necessary consequence ofA.In this case,Ais called thehypothesisof the theorem ("hypothesis" here means something very different from aconjecture), andBtheconclusionof the theorem. The two together (without the proof) are called thepropositionorstatementof the theorem (e.g. "If A, then B" is theproposition). Alternatively,AandBcan be also termed theantecedentand theconsequent, respectively.[10]The theorem "Ifnis an evennatural number, thenn/2 is a natural number" is a typical example in which the hypothesis is "nis an even natural number", and the conclusion is "n/2 is also a natural number".In order for a theorem to be proved, it must be in principle expressible as a precise, formal statement. However, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form—with the presumption that a formal statement can be derived from the informal one.It is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are calledaxiomsor postulates. The field of mathematics known asproof theorystudies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.Aplanarmap with five colors such that no two regions with the same color meet. It can actually be colored in this way with only four colors. Thefour color theoremstates that such colorings are possible for any planar map, but every known proof involves a computational search that is too long to check by hand.Some theorems are "trivial", in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights. Some, on the other hand, may be called "deep", because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics.[11]A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example isFermat's Last Theorem,[9]and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems innumber theoryandcombinatorics, among other areas.Other theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and theKepler conjecture. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematicianDoron Zeilbergerhas even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved.[12]Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities[13]and hypergeometric identities.[14][page needed]Relation with scientific theories[edit]Theorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in theirepistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it isfalsifiable, that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable byexperiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.[6]TheCollatz conjecture: one way to illustrate its complexity is to extend the iteration from the natural numbers to the complex numbers. The result is afractal, which (in accordance withuniversality) resembles theMandelbrot set.Nonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. It is also possible to find a single counter-example and so establish the impossibility of a proof for the proposition as-stated, and possibly suggest restricted forms of the original proposition that might have feasible proofs.For example, both theCollatz conjectureand theRiemann hypothesisare well-known unsolved problems; they have been extensively studied through empirical checks, but remain unproven. TheCollatz conjecturehas been verified for start values up to about 2.88 × 1018. TheRiemann hypothesishas been verified to hold for the first 10 trillion non-trivial zeroes of thezeta function. Although most mathematicians can tolerate supposing that the conjecture and the hypothesis are true, neither of these propositions is considered proved.Such evidence does not constitute proof. For example, theMertens conjectureis a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural numbernfor which the Mertens functionM(n) equals or exceeds the square root ofn) is known: all numbers less than 1014have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than theexponentialof 1.59 × 1040, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3 × 1039. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (agoogol), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample byexhaustive search.The word "theory" also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example,group theory(seemathematical theory). There are also "theorems" in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such "theorems" are based are themselves falsifiable.Terminology[edit]A number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary, and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.Anaxiomorpostulateis a fundamental assumption regarding the object of study, that is accepted without proof. A related concept is that of adefinition, which gives the meaning of a word or a phrase in terms of known concepts. Classical geometry discerns between axioms, which are general statements; and postulates, which are statements about geometrical objects.[15]Historically, axioms were regarded as "self-evident"; today they are merelyassumedto be true.Aconjectureis an unproved statement that is believed to be true. Conjectures are usually made in public, and named after their maker (for example,Goldbach's conjectureandCollatz conjecture). The termhypothesisis also used in this sense (for example,Riemann hypothesis), which should not be confused with "hypothesis" as the premise of a proof. Other terms are also used on occasion, for exampleproblemwhen people are not sure whether the statement should be believed to be true.Fermat's Last Theoremwas historically called a theorem, although, for centuries, it was only a conjecture.Atheoremis a statement that has been proven to be true based on axioms and other theorems.Apropositionis a theorem of lesser importance, or one that is considered so elementary or immediately obvious, that it may be stated without proof. This should not be confused with "proposition" as used inpropositional logic. In classical geometry the term "proposition" was used differently: inEuclid'sElements(c.300 BCE), all theorems and geometric constructions were called "propositions" regardless of their importance.Alemmais an "accessory proposition" - a proposition with little applicability outside its use in a particular proof. Over time a lemma may gain in importance and be considered atheorem, though the term "lemma" is usually kept as part of its name (e.g.Gauss's lemma,Zorn's lemma, andthe fundamental lemma).Acorollaryis a proposition that follows immediately from another theorem or axiom, with little or no required proof.[16]A corollary may also be a restatement of a theorem in a simpler form, or for aspecial case: for example, the theorem "all internal angles in arectangleareright angles" has a corollary that "all internal angles in asquareareright angles" - a square being a special case of a rectangle.Ageneralizationof a theorem is a theorem with a similar statement but a broader scope, from which the original theorem can be deduced as aspecial case(acorollary).[d]Other terms may also be used for historical or customary reasons, for example:Anidentityis a theorem stating an equality between two expressions, that holds for any value within itsdomain(e.g.Bézout's identityandVandermonde's identity).Aruleis a theorem that establishes a useful formula (e.g.Bayes' ruleandCramer's rule).Alaworprincipleis a theorem with wide applicability (e.g. thelaw of large numbers,law of cosines,Kolmogorov's zero–one law,Harnack's principle, theleast-upper-bound principle, and thepigeonhole principle).[e]A few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names, for example, thedivision algorithm,Euler's formula, and theBanach–Tarski paradox.Layout[edit]A theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:Theorem(name of the person who proved it, along with year of discovery or publication of the proof)Statement of theorem (sometimes called theproposition)ProofDescription of proofEndThe end of the proof may be signaled by the lettersQ.E.D.(quod erat demonstrandum) or by one of thetombstonemarks, such as "□" or "∎", meaning "end of proof", introduced byPaul Halmosfollowing their use in magazines to mark the end of an article.[17]The exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions ormacrosfor typesetting in thehouse style.It is common for a theorem to be preceded bydefinitionsdescribing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.Corollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.Lore[edit]It has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.[18]The well-knownaphorism,"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems", is probably due toAlfréd Rényi, although it is often attributed to Rényi's colleaguePaul Erdős(and Rényi may have been thinking of Erdős), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, thenumberof his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.[19]Theclassification of finite simple groupsis regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof.[20]Another theorem of this type is thefour color theoremwhose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is among the longest known proofs of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.[citation needed]Theorems in logic[edit]Inmathematical logic, aformal theoryis a set of sentences within aformal language. A sentence is awell-formed formulawith no free variables. A sentence that is a member of a theory is one of its theorems, and the theory is the set of its theorems. Usually a theory is understood to be closed under the relation oflogical consequence. Some accounts define a theory to be closed under thesemantic consequencerelation (⊨{\displaystyle \models }), while others define it to be closed under thesyntactic consequence, or derivability relation (⊢{\displaystyle \vdash }).[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30]This diagram shows thesyntactic entitiesthat can be constructed fromformal languages. Thesymbolsandstrings of symbolsmay be broadly divided intononsenseandwell-formed formulas. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.For a theory to be closed under a derivability relation, it must be associated with adeductive systemthat specifies how the theorems are derived. The deductive system may be stated explicitly, or it may be clear from the context. The closure of the empty set under the relation of logical consequence yields the set that contains just those sentences that are the theorems of the deductive system.In the broad sense in which the term is used within logic, a theorem does not have to be true, since the theory that contains it may beunsoundrelative to a given semantics, or relative to the standardinterpretationof the underlying language. A theory that isinconsistenthas all sentences as theorems.The definition of theorems as sentences of a formal language is useful withinproof theory, which is a branch of mathematics that studies the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. It is also important inmodel theory, which is concerned with the relationship between formal theories and structures that are able to provide a semantics for them throughinterpretation.Although theorems may be uninterpreted sentences, in practice mathematicians are more interested in the meanings of the sentences, i.e. in the propositions they express. What makes formal theorems useful and interesting is that they may be interpreted as true propositions and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of their truth. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statementabouta formal system (as opposed towithina formal system) is called ametatheorem.Some important theorems in mathematical logic are:Compactness of first-order logicCompleteness of first-order logicGödel's incompleteness theorems of first-order arithmeticConsistency of first-order arithmeticTarski's undefinability theoremChurch-Turing theorem of undecidabilityLöb's theoremLöwenheim–Skolem theoremLindström's theoremCraig's theoremCut-elimination theoremSyntax and semantics[edit]Main articles:Syntax (logic)andFormal semantics (logic)The concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of atrue proposition,which introducessemantics. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e.belief,justificationor othermodalities). Thesoundnessof a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are alsovalidities. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation (for example, in classical propositional logic, validities aretautologies). A formal system is consideredsemantically completewhen all of its theorems are also tautologies.Interpretation of a formal theorem[edit]Main article:Interpretation (logic)Theorems and theories[edit]Main articles:TheoryandTheory (mathematical logic)See also[edit]Philosophy portalMathematics portalLaw (mathematics)List of theoremsList of theorems called fundamentalFormulaInferenceToy theoremNotes[edit]^In general, the distinction is weak, as the standard way to prove that a statement is provable consists of proving it. However, in mathematical logic, one considers often the set of all theorems of a theory, although one cannot prove them individually.^An exception is the originalWiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which relies implicitly onGrothendieck universes, whose existence requires the addition of a new axiom to set theory.[4]This reliance on a new axiom of set theory has since been removed.[5]Nevertheless, it is rather astonishing that the first proof of a statement expressed in elementaryarithmeticinvolves the existence of very large infinite sets.^A theory is often identified with the set of its theorems. This is avoided here for clarity, and also for not depending onset theory.^Often, when the less general or "corollary"-like theorem is proven first, it is because the proof of the more general form requires the simpler, corollary-like form, for use as a what is functionally a lemma, or "helper" theorem.^The wordlawcan also refer to an axiom, arule of inference, or, inprobability theory, aprobability distribution.References[edit]^Elisha Scott Loomis."The Pythagorean proposition: its demonstrations analyzed and classified, and bibliography of sources for data of the four kinds of proofs"(PDF).Education Resources Information Center.Institute of Education Sciences(IES) of theU.S. Department of Education.
