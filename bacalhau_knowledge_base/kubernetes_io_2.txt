Kubernetes builds upon15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.Planet ScaleDesigned on the same principles that allow Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your operations team.Never OutgrowWhether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.Run K8s AnywhereKubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.To download Kubernetes, visit thedownloadsection.The Challenges of Migrating 150+ Microservices to KubernetesBy Sarah Wells, Technical Director for Operations and Reliability, Financial TimesWatch VideoAttend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon China on August 21-23Attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America on November 12-15Attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon India on December 11-12Kubernetes FeaturesAutomated rollouts and rollbacksKubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of deployment solutions.Service discovery and load balancingNo need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.Storage orchestrationAutomatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider, or a network storage system such as iSCSI or NFS.Self-healingRestarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.Secret and configuration managementDeploy and update Secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing Secrets in your stack configuration.Automatic bin packingAutomatically places containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. Mix critical and best-effort workloads in order to drive up utilization and save even more resources.Batch executionIn addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired.Horizontal scalingScale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.IPv4/IPv6 dual-stackAllocation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and ServicesDesigned for extensibilityAdd features to your Kubernetes cluster without changing upstream source code.Case Studies"Kubernetes is a great platform for machine learning because it comes with all the scheduling and …"Read more"Kubernetes is a great solution for us.
