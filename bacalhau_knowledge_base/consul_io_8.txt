Customers are moving many applications to the cloud while keeping others on-premises. Customers are also adopting microservices, many of which need to communicate with existing legacy services. This is a common scenario where customers now struggle to manage and connect their services in a consistent manner across different clouds, platforms, runtimes, and networks.SolutionConsistency across multiple clouds and platformsDeploy in any public cloud or on-premises environment and on any deployment type, including VMs, Kubernetes, or Nomad. This consistent dataplane allows developers to connect their services between heterogeneous environments regardless of whether they are running on VMs in an on-premises datacenter or on a managed Kubernetes service like EKS, AKS, or GKE.Consul supports true multi-tenancy with administrative partitions. Multiple deployments can remain under a single control plane, allowing for consistent management and governance while maintaining autonomy and isolation for different tenants. Operators can choose to self-manage their own Consul deployments or opt for a fully managed solution with HCP for Consul.Customer case studyTide's self-service service mesh with HCP Consul​​Learn how Tide abandoned its adoption of AWS AppMesh in favor of HashiCorp Consul, making the transition in only 6 weeks with no downtime and no big-bang migration.Read moreTutorialsExplore allTutorialDeploy Consul on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)Deploy a Consul datacenter on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with the official Helm chart.TutorialDeploy Consul on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)Deploy a Consul datacenter to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with HashiCorp’s official Helm chart.TutorialDeploy federated multi-cloud Kubernetes clustersProvision and configure Consul federation with mesh gateways across the Azure and AWS.
