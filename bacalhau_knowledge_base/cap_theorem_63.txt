For the Microsoft technology, seeCOM Structured Storage.This articlemay be too technical for most readers to understand.Pleasehelp improve ittomake it understandable to non-experts, without removing the technical details.(December 2023)(Learn how and when to remove this message)NoSQL(originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational")[1]is an approach todatabasedesign that focuses on providing a mechanism forstorageandretrievalof data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used inrelational databases. Instead of the typical tabular structure of a relational database, NoSQL databases house data within one data structure. Since this non-relational database design does not require aschema, it offers rapid scalability to manage large and typically unstructured data sets.[2]NoSQL systems are also sometimes called"Not only SQL"to emphasize that they may supportSQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases inpolyglot-persistentarchitectures.[3][4]Non-relational databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 2000s,[5]triggered by the needs ofWeb 2.0companies.[6][7]NoSQL databases are increasingly used inbig dataandreal-time webapplications.[8]Motivations for this approach include simplicity ofdesign, simpler"horizontal" scalingtoclusters of machines(which is a problem for relational databases),[5]finer control overavailability, and limiting theobject-relational impedance mismatch.[9]Thedata structuresused by NoSQL databases (e.g.key–value pair,wide column,graph, ordocument) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve.  Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as "more flexible" than relationaldatabase tables.[10]Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of theCAP theorem) in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed. Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of low-levelquery languages(instead of SQL, for instance), lack of ability to perform ad hocjoinsacross tables, lack of standardized interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational databases.[11]Most NoSQL stores lack trueACIDtransactions, although a few databases have made them central to their designs.Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of "eventual consistency", in which database changes are propagated to all nodes "eventually" (typically within milliseconds), so queries for data might not return updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not accurate, a problem known asstale read.[12]Additionally, some NoSQL systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms ofdata loss.[13]Some NoSQL systems provide concepts such aswrite-ahead loggingto avoid data loss.[14]Fordistributed transaction processingacross multiple databases, data consistency is an even bigger challenge that is difficult for both NoSQL and relational databases. Relational databases "do not allow referential integrity constraints to span databases".[15]Few systems maintain bothACIDtransactions andX/Open XAstandards fordistributed transaction processing.[16]Interactive relational databases share conformational relay analysis techniques as a common feature.[17]Limitations within the interface environment are overcome using semantic virtualization protocols, such that NoSQL services are accessible to mostoperating systems.[18]History[edit]The termNoSQLwas used by Carlo Strozzi in 1998 to name his lightweightStrozzi NoSQL open-source relational databasethat did not expose the standardStructured Query Language(SQL) interface, but was still relational.[19]His NoSQLRDBMSis distinct from the around-2009 general concept of NoSQL databases.  Strozzi suggests that, because the current NoSQL movement "departs from the relational model altogether, it should therefore have been called more appropriately 'NoREL'",[20]referring to "not relational".Johan Oskarsson, then a developer atLast.fm, reintroduced the termNoSQLin early 2009 when he organized an event to discuss "open-sourcedistributed, non-relational databases".[21]The name attempted to label the emergence of an increasing number of non-relational, distributed data stores, including open source clones of Google'sBigtable/MapReduceand Amazon'sDynamoDB.Types and examples[edit]There are various ways to classify NoSQL databases, with different categories and subcategories, some of which overlap. What follows is a non-exhaustive classification by data model, with examples:[22]TypeNotable examples of this typeKey–value cacheApache Ignite,Couchbase,Coherence,eXtreme Scale,Hazelcast,Infinispan,Memcached,Redis,VelocityKey–value storeAzure Cosmos DB,ArangoDB,Amazon DynamoDB,Aerospike,Couchbase,ScyllaDBKey–value store (eventually consistent)Azure Cosmos DB,Oracle NoSQL Database,Riak,VoldemortKey–value store (ordered)FoundationDB,InfinityDB,LMDB,MemcacheDBTuple storeApache River,GigaSpaces,Tarantool,TIBCOActiveSpaces,OpenLink VirtuosoTriplestoreAllegroGraph,MarkLogic,Ontotext-OWLIM,Oracle NoSQL database, Profium Sense,Virtuoso Universal ServerObject databaseObjectivity/DB,Perst,ZODB,db4o,GemStone/S,InterSystems Caché,JADE,ObjectDatabase++,ObjectDB,ObjectStore,ODABA,Realm,OpenLink Virtuoso,Versant Object DatabaseDocument storeAzure Cosmos DB,ArangoDB,BaseX,Clusterpoint,Couchbase,CouchDB,DocumentDB,eXist-db,Google Cloud Firestore,IBM Domino,MarkLogic,MongoDB,RavenDB,Qizx,RethinkDB,Elasticsearch,OrientDBWide-column storeAzure Cosmos DB,Amazon DynamoDB,Bigtable,Cassandra,Google Cloud Datastore,HBase,Hypertable,ScyllaDBNative multi-model databaseArangoDB,Azure Cosmos DB,OrientDB,MarkLogic,Apache Ignite,[23][24]Couchbase,FoundationDB,Oracle DatabaseGraph databaseAzure Cosmos DB,AllegroGraph,ArangoDB,InfiniteGraph,Apache Giraph,MarkLogic,Neo4J,OrientDB,VirtuosoMultivalue databaseD3Pick database,Extensible Storage Engine(ESE/NT),InfinityDB,InterSystems Caché, jBASEPick database, mvBaseRocket Software, mvEnterpriseRocket Software,Northgate Information SolutionsReality (the original Pick/MV Database),OpenQM, Revelation Software's OpenInsight (Windows) and Advanced Revelation (DOS), UniDataRocket U2, UniVerseRocket U2Key–value store[edit]Main article:Key–value databaseKey–value (KV) stores use theassociative array(also called a map or dictionary) as their fundamental data model. In this model, data is represented as a collection of key–value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.[25][26]The key–value model is one of the simplest non-trivial data models, and richer data models are often implemented as an extension of it. The key–value model can be extended to a discretely ordered model that maintains keys inlexicographic order. This extension is computationally powerful, in that it can efficiently retrieve selective keyranges.[27]Key–value stores can useconsistency modelsranging fromeventual consistencytoserializability. Some databases support ordering of keys. There are various hardware implementations, and some users store data in memory (RAM), while others onsolid-state drives(SSD) orrotating disks(aka hard disk drive (HDD)).Document store[edit]Main articles:Document-oriented databaseandXML databaseThe central concept of a document store is that of a "document". While the details of this definition differ among document-oriented databases, they all assume that documents encapsulate and encode data (or information) in some standard formats or encodings. Encodings in use includeXML,YAML, andJSONandbinaryforms likeBSON. Documents are addressed in the database via a uniquekeythat represents that document. Another defining characteristic of a document-oriented database is anAPIor query language to retrieve documents based on their contents.Different implementations offer different ways of organizing and/or grouping documents:CollectionsTagsNon-visiblemetadataDirectory hierarchiesCompared to relational databases, collections could be considered analogous to tables and documents analogous to records. But they are different – every record in a table has the same sequence of fields, while documents in a collection may have fields that are completely different.Graph[edit]Main article:Graph databaseGraph databases are designed for data whose relations are well represented as agraphconsisting of elements connected by a finite number of relations. Examples of data includesocial relations, public transport links, road maps, network topologies, etc.Graph databases and their query languageNameLanguage(s)NotesAllegroGraphSPARQLRDFtriple storeAmazon NeptuneGremlin,SPARQLGraph databaseArangoDBAQL,JavaScript,GraphQLMulti-model DBMSDocument,Graph databaseandKey-value storeAzure Cosmos DBGremlinGraph databaseDEX/SparkseeC++,Java,C#,PythonGraph databaseFlockDBScalaGraph databaseIBM Db2SPARQLRDFtriple store added in DB2 10InfiniteGraphJavaGraph databaseJanusGraphJavaGraph databaseMarkLogicJava,JavaScript,SPARQL,XQueryMulti-modeldocument databaseandRDFtriple storeNeo4jCypherGraph databaseOpenLink VirtuosoC++,C#,Java,SPARQLMiddlewareanddatabase enginehybridOracleSPARQL 1.1RDFtriple store added in 11gOrientDBJava, SQLMulti-modeldocumentandgraph databaseOWLIMJava,SPARQL 1.1RDFtriple storeProfium SenseJava,SPARQLRDFtriple storeRedisGraphCypherGraph databaseSqrrl EnterpriseJavaGraph databaseTerminusDBJavaScript,Python,datalogOpen source RDF triple-store and document store[28]Performance[edit]The performance of NoSQL databases is usually evaluated using the metric ofthroughput, which is measured as operations/second. Performance evaluation must pay attention to the rightbenchmarkssuch as production configurations, parameters of the databases, anticipated data volume, and concurrent userworkloads.Ben Scofield rated different categories of NoSQL databases as follows:[29]Data modelPerformanceScalabilityFlexibilityComplexityData IntegrityFunctionalityKey–value storehighhighhighnonelowvariable (none)Column-oriented storehighhighmoderatelowlowminimalDocument-oriented storehighvariable (high)highlowlowvariable (low)Graph databasevariablevariablehighhighlow-medgraph theoryRelational databasevariablevariablelowmoderatehighrelational algebraPerformance and scalability comparisons are most commonly done using theYCSBbenchmark.Handling relational data[edit]Since most NoSQL databases lack ability for joins in queries, thedatabase schemagenerally needs to be designed differently. There are three main techniques for handling relational data in a NoSQL database. (See table Join and ACID Support for NoSQL databases that support joins.)Multiple queries[edit]Instead of retrieving all the data with one query, it is common to do several queries to get the desired data. NoSQL queries are often faster than traditional SQL queries so the cost of additional queries may be acceptable. If an excessive number of queries would be necessary, one of the other two approaches is more appropriate.Caching, replication and non-normalized data[edit]Instead of only storing foreign keys, it is common to store actual foreign values along with the model's data. For example, each blog comment might include the username in addition to a user id, thus providing easy access to the username without requiring another lookup. When a username changes however, this will now need to be changed in many places in the database. Thus this approach works better when reads are much more common than writes.[30]Nesting data[edit]With document databases like MongoDB it is common to put more data in a smaller number of collections. For example, in a blogging application, one might choose to store comments within the blog post document so that with a single retrieval one gets all the comments. Thus in this approach a single document contains all the data you need for a specific task.ACID and join support[edit]A database is marked as supportingACIDproperties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) orjoinoperations if the documentation for the database makes that claim. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the capability is fully supported in a manner similar to most SQL databases.DatabaseACIDJoinsAerospikeYesNoApache IgniteYesYesArangoDBYesYesAmazon DynamoDBYesNoCouchbaseYesYesCouchDBYesYesIBM Db2YesYesInfinityDBYesNoLMDBYesNoMarkLogicYesYes[nb 1]MongoDBYesYes[nb 2]OrientDBYesYes[nb 3]^Joins do not necessarily apply to document databases, but MarkLogic can do joins using semantics.[31]^MongoDB did not support joining from a sharded collection until version 5.1.[32]^OrientDB can resolve 1:1 joins using links by storing direct links to foreign records.[33]See also[edit]CAP theoremComparison of object database management systemsComparison of structured storage softwareC++Database scalabilityDistributed cacheFaceted searchMultiValuedatabaseMulti-model databaseSchema-agnostic databasesTriplestoreVector databaseReferences[edit]^http://nosql-database.org/"NoSQL DEFINITION: Next Generation Databases mostly addressing some of the points : being non-relational, distributed, open-source and horizontally scalable".^"What Is a NoSQL Database? | IBM".www.ibm.com. 12 December 2022.

Stackexchange. Retrieved1 January2012.Key–value stores allow the application developer to store schema-less data. This data usually consists of a string that represents the key, and the actual data that is considered the value in the "key–value" relationship. The data itself is usually some kind of primitive of the programming language (a string, an integer, or an array) or an object that is being marshaled by the programming language's bindings to the key-value store. This structure replaces the need for a fixed data model and allows proper formatting.^Seeger, Marc (21 September 2009)."Key-Value Stores: a practical overview"(PDF). Marc Seeger.
