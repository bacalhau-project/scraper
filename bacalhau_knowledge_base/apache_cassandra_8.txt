The Cassandra PMC is tasked with project managementâespecially technical direction, votes on new committers and PMC members for the project, and sets policies as well as formally voting on software product releases. Our guiding philosophies are to default to the dev list and âdecide as a community,â and to favor PMC minimalism.ASF Project Independence OverviewCassandra PMC Governance OverviewASF PMC OverviewThe Apache WayHow to ContributeBecoming a contributorContributors are individuals who contribute patchesâsource code, documentation, help on mailing lists, websiteâto Apache projects. While contributors do not have a specific governance role, they are crucial to the projectâs success. Read the docs to learn how tocontribute to Cassandra, and review ourgovernancepage to understand how we vote on code contributions.Becoming a CommitterCommitters are members of a project development community who have been granted write access to an Apache project. New committers and PMC members are elected by the Cassandra PMC based on merit.More on committers.Reporting BugsIf you encounter a problem with Cassandra, the first places to ask for help are theuser mailing listand the #cassandraSlack channel.If, after having asked for help, you suspect that you have found a bug in Cassandra, you should report it by opening a ticket through theApache Cassandra JIRA tracking system. Please provide as much detail as you can on your problem.
