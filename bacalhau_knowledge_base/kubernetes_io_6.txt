The Kubernetes community — users, contributors, and the culture we've built together — is one of the biggest reasons for the meteoric rise of this open source project. Our culture and values continue to grow and change as the project itself grows and changes. We all work together toward constant improvement of the project and the ways we work on it.
We are the people who file issues and pull requests, attend SIG meetings,
Kubernetes meetups, and KubeCon, advocate for its adoption and innovation,
run kubectl get pods
, and contribute in a thousand other vital
ways. Read on to learn how you can get involved and become part of this amazing
community.
The Kubernetes Community values are the keystone to the ongoing success of the project.
These principles guide every aspect of the Kubernetes project.
The Kubernetes community values respect and inclusiveness, and enforces a Code of Conduct in all interactions.
If you notice a violation of the Code of Conduct at an event or meeting, in [Slack](#slack), or in another communication mechanism, reach out to the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee at [conduct@kubernetes.io](mailto:conduct@kubernetes.io). All reports are kept confidential. You can read [about the committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/committee-code-of-conduct) in the Kubernetes community repository on GitHub.
