Install
Requirements
Before installing etcd, see the following pages:
Install pre-built binaries
The easiest way to install etcd is from pre-built binaries:
Download the compressed archive file for your platform from
[Releases](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/), choosing release[v3.4.33](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.4.33)or later.Unpack the archive file. This results in a directory containing the binaries.
Add the executable binaries to your path. For example, rename and/or move the binaries to a directory in your path (like
/usr/local/bin
), or add the directory created by the previous step to your path.From a shell, test that
etcd
is in your path:$ etcd --version etcd Version: 3.4.33 ...
Build from source
If you have [Go version 1.2+](https://golang.org/doc/install), you can build etcd from
source by following these steps:
[Download the etcd repo as a zip file](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/archive/v3.4.33.zip)and unzip it, or clone the repo using the following command.$ git clone -b v3.4.33 https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd.git
To build from
main@HEAD
, omit the-b v3.4.33
flag.Change directory:
$ cd etcd
Run the build script:
$ ./build
The binaries are under the
bin
directory.Add the full path to the
bin
directory to your path, for example:$ export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/bin"
Test that
etcd
is in your path:$ etcd --version
Installation check
For a slightly more involved sanity check of your installation, see
[Quickstart](/docs/v3.4/quickstart/).
