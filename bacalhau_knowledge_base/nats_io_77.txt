AboutDownloadDocumentationBlogCommunitySupportPrivacyCommunity Update at The London NATS User Group MeetupBrian Flannery— November 9, 2015Back to BlogThe audience at the London Meetup was great! We had many local companies represented, and some of the leaders of other meetups such as Alexandre González Rodríguez (one of the organizers of theGo London! Meetups), and Milos Gajdos (co-organizer of theKubernetes LondonMeetups) present as well. I enjoyed meeting everyone, and getting your feedback after the talks.My talk was focused primarily on:What is NATS? Some meetup members were new to NATS, so in a nutshell, NATS boils down to simplicity and mind-blowing speed. Raul Perez had a great anecdote in his talk about how fast NATS was, even on his Macbook Air, where NATS nearly “melted” his machine!Some performance characteristics of NATS, where I discussed some benchmarks fromTyler Treat’s blogand also from CenturyLink’sImageLayers.iotool, which David Williams explained nicely in a recent tweet:@jdsboston@brianflanneryLayers how simple NATS image is: a Go binary, config file, and Docker params:https://t.co/lHBVSraTJb— David Williams (@DavWilliams)October 13, 2015Finally, we covered some recent updates in the NATS community:Great monitoring tools such asNatsboardandNatsmonNew clients from the community such as Rust and Lua, and supported ones like theC Clientby Apcera, as well as integrations with tools likeSymfony 2.NewNATS.io website!
