The CredentialProvider API is an SPI framework for plugging in extensible credential providers. Credential providers are used to separate the use of sensitive tokens, secrets and passwords from the details of their storage and management. The ability to choose various storage mechanisms for protecting these credentials allows us to keep such sensitive assets out of clear text, away from prying eyes and potentially to be managed by third party solutions.
This document aims to describe the design of the CredentialProvider API, the out of the box implementations, where they are used and how to adopt their use.
Let’s provide a quick overview of the use of the credential provider framework for protecting passwords or other sensitive tokens in hadoop.
There are certain deployments that are very sensitive to how sensitive tokens like passwords are stored and managed within the cluster. For instance, there may be security best practices and policies in place that require such things to never be stored in clear text, for example. Enterprise deployments may be required to use a preferred solution for managing credentials and we need a way to plug in integrations for them.
There are numerous places within the Hadoop project and ecosystem that can leverage the credential provider API today and the number continues to grow. In general, the usage pattern consists of the same requirements and flow.
hadoop.security.credential.provider.path
is a comma separated list of one or more credential provider URIs that is traversed while trying to resolve a credential alias.
org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration
class for configuration or have other internal uses for the credential providers may choose to use the CredentialProvider
API itself. An example of its use can be found within Example: ssl.server.keystore.password
hadoop credential create ssl.server.keystore.password -value 123 \ -provider localjceks://file/home/lmccay/aws.jceks
The alias names are the same as the configuration properties that were used to get the credentials from the Configuration.get()
methods.
Now, we need to make sure that this provisioned credential store is known at runtime by the [Configuration.getPassword](../../api/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.html#getPassword-java.lang.String-) method. If there is no credential provider path configuration then Configuration.getPassword()
will skip the credential provider API interrogation. So, it is important that the following be configured within core-site.xml
or your component’s equivalent.
<property> <name>hadoop.security.credential.provider.path</name> <value>localjceks://file/home/lmccay/aws.jceks</value> <description>Path to interrogate for protected credentials.</description> </property>
A couple additional things to note about the provider path:
localjceks
provider does not have a dependency on the Hadoop FileSystem APIs. and is needed sometimes to avoid a recursive dependency. Another provider represented by jceks
, does use the Hadoop FileSystem APIs and can support keystores provisioned within HDFS or other compatible filesystems. A third provider type is the user
type. This provider can manage credentials stored within the Credentials file for a process.In summary, first, provision the credentials into a provider then configure the provider for use by a feature or component and it will often just be picked up through the use of the [Configuration.getPassword](../../api/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.html#getPassword-java.lang.String-) method.

CommandUsage: hadoop credential <subcommand> [options]
See the command options detail in the [Commands Manual](CommandsManual.html#credential)
The credential command can be for provisioning a password or secret to a particular credential store provider. In order to explicitly indicate which provider store to use the -provider
option should be used.
Example: hadoop credential create ssl.server.keystore.password -provider jceks://file/tmp/test.jceks
In order to indicate a particular provider type and location, the user must provide the hadoop.security.credential.provider.path
configuration element in core-site.xml or use the command line option -provider
on each of the credential management commands. This provider path is a comma-separated list of URLs that indicates the type and location of a list of providers that should be consulted. For example, the following path: user:///,jceks://file/tmp/test.jceks,jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com/my/path/test.jceks
indicates that the current user’s credentials file should be consulted through the User Provider, that the local file located at /tmp/test.jceks
is a Java Keystore Provider and that the file located within HDFS at nn1.example.com/my/path/test.jceks
is also a store for a Java Keystore Provider.
UserProvider
, which is represented by the provider URI user:///
, is used to retrieve credentials from a user’s Credentials file. This file is used to store various tokens, secrets and passwords that are needed by executing jobs and applications.JavaKeyStoreProvider
, which is represented by the provider URI jceks://SCHEME/path-to-keystore
, is used to retrieve credentials from a Java keystore file in a filesystem <SCHEME>
The underlying use of the Hadoop filesystem API allows credentials to be stored on the local filesystem or within cluster stores.LocalJavaKeyStoreProvider
, which is represented by the provider URI localjceks://file/path-to-keystore
, is used to access credentials from a Java keystore that must be stored on the local filesystem. This is needed for credentials that would result in a recursive dependency on accessing HDFS. Anytime that your credential is required to gain access to HDFS we can’t depend on getting a credential out of HDFS to do so.BouncyCastleFIPSKeyStoreProvider
, which is represented by the provider URI bcfks://SCHEME/path-to-keystore
, is used to retrieve credentials from a Bouncy Castle FIPS keystore file in a file system <SCHEME>
The underlying use of the Hadoop filesystem API allows credentials to be stored on the local filesystem or within cluster stores.LocalBcouncyCastleFIPSKeyStoreProvider
, which is represented by the provider URI localbcfks://file/path-to-keystore
, is used to access credentials from a Bouncy Castle FIPS keystore that must be stored on the local filesystem. This is needed for credentials that would result in a recursive dependency on accessing HDFS. Anytime that your credential is required to gain access to HDFS we can’t depend on getting a credential out of HDFS to do so.When credentials are stored in a filesystem, the following rules apply:
Credentials stored in local localjceks://
or localbcfks://
files are loaded in the process reading in the configuration. For use in a YARN application, this means that they must be visible across the entire cluster, in the local filesystems of the hosts.
Credentials stored with the jceks://
or bcfks://
provider can be stored in the cluster filesystem, and so visible across the cluster —but not in the filesystem which requires the specific credentials for their access.
To wrap filesystem URIs with a jceks
URI follow these steps. Bouncy Castle FIPS provider follows a similar step by replacing jceks
with bcfks
along with OS/JDK level FIPS provider configured.
hdfs://namenode:9001/users/alice/secrets.jceks
jceks://
in front of the URL: jceks://hdfs://namenode:9001/users/alice/secrets.jceks
://
string with an @
symbol: jceks://hdfs@namenode:9001/users/alice/secrets.jceks
Examples
For a local filesystem, a path such as file:///tmp/secrets.jceks
would become: jceks://file/tmp/secrets.jceks
Path URI | jceks URI |
---|---|
hdfs://namenode.example.org:9001/user/alice/secret.jceks |
jceks://hdfs@namenode.example.org:9001/user/alice/secret.jceks |
file:///tmp/secrets.jceks |
jceks://file/tmp/secret.jceks |
s3a://container1/secrets/secret.jceks |
jceks://s3a@container1/secrets/secret.jceks |
wasb://account@container/secret.jceks |
jceks://wasb@account@container/secret.jceks |
abfs://account@container/secret.jceks |
jceks://abfs@account@container/secret.jceks |
https://user:pass@service/secret.jceks?token=aia |
jceks://https@user:pass@service/secret.jceks?token=aia |
Note that to avoid infinite recursion, filesystems such as abfs
, s3a
, adls
and wasb
explicitly exclude keystores stored on paths in their own filesystem schemes, even if they are stored in a container which uses a different set of credentials from those being looked up.
As an example, you cannot use credentials stored in s3a://shared/secrets/secret.jceks
to read the credentials for the container s3a://private/
.
Keystores in Java are generally protected by passwords. The primary method of protection of the keystore-based credential providers are OS-level file permissions and any other policy based access protection that may exist for the target filesystem. While the password is not a primary source of protection, it is very important to understand the mechanics required and options available for managing these passwords. It is also very important to understand all the parties that will need access to the password used to protect the keystores in order to consume them at runtime.
Option | Description | Notes |
---|---|---|
Default password | This is a harcoded password of “none”. | This is a hardcoded password in an open source project and as such has obvious disadvantages. However, the mechanics section will show that it is simpler and consequently nearly as secure as the other more complex options. |
Environment variable | HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD |
This option uses an environment variable to communicate the password that should be used when interrogating all of the keystores that are configured in the hadoop.security.credential.provider.path configuration property. All of the keystore based providers in the path will need to be protected by the same password. |
Password-file | hadoop.security.credstore.java-keystore-provider.password-file |
This option uses a “side file” that has its location configured in the hadoop.security.credstore.java-keystore-provider.password-file configuration property to communicate the password that should be used when interrogating all of the keystores that are configured in the hadoop.security.credential.provider.path configuration property. |
Extremely important to consider that all of the runtime consumers of the credential being protected (mapreduce jobs/applications) will need to have access to the password used to protect the keystore providers. Communicating this password can be done a number of ways and they are described in the Options section above.
Keystore Password | Description | Sync Required | Clear Text | File Permissions |
---|---|---|---|---|
Default Password | Hardcoded password is the default. Essentially, when using the default password for all keystore-based credential stores, we are leveraging the file permissions to protect the credential store and the keystore password is just a formality of persisting the keystore. | No | Yes | No (documented) |
Environment Variable | The HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD environment variable must be set to the custom password for all keystores that may be configured in the provider path of any process that needs to access credentials from a keystore-based credential provider. There is only one env variable for the entire path of comma-separated providers. It is difficult to know the passwords required for each keystore and it is suggested that the same be used for all keystore-based credential providers to avoid this issue. Setting the environment variable will likely require it to be set from a script or some other clear text storage mechanism. Environment variables for running processes are available from various unix commands. |
Yes | Yes | No |
Password File | hadoop.security.credstore.java-keystore-provider.password-file configuration property must be set to the location of the “side file” that contains the custom password for all keystores that may be configured in the provider path. Any process that needs to access credentials from a keystore-based credential provider will need to have this configuration property set to the appropriate file location. There is only one password-file for the entire path of comma separated providers. It is difficult to know the passwords required for each keystore and it is therefore suggested that the same be used for all keystore-based credential providers to avoid this issue. Password-files are additional files that need to be managed, store the password in clear text and need file permissions to be set such that only those that need access to them have it. If file permissions are set inappropriately the password to access the keystores is available in clear text. |
Yes | Yes | Yes |
The use of the default password means that no additional communication/synchronization to runtime consumers needs to be done. The default password is known but file permissions are the primary protection of the keystore.
When file permissions are thwarted, unlike “side files”, there are no standard tools that can expose the protected credentials - even with the password known. Keytool requires a password that is six characters or more and doesn’t know how to retrieve general secrets from a keystore. It is also limited to PKI keypairs. Editors will not reveal the secrets stored within the keystore, nor will cat
, more
or any other standard tools. This is why the keystore providers are better than “side file” storage of credentials.
That said, it is trivial for someone to write code to access the credentials stored within a keystore-based credential provider using the API. Again, when using the default password, the password is merely a formality of persisting the keystore. The only protection is file permissions and OS level access policy.
Users may decide to use a password “side file” to store the password for the keystores themselves and this is supported. It is just really important to be aware of the mechanics required for this level of correctness.
The Credentials.getPassword()
operation falls back to using entries in the configuration XML files if there are no credential providers, or if a key cannot be found.
This action can be disabled by changing the configuration option hadoop.security.credential.clear-text-fallback
from true
to false
:
<property> <name>hadoop.security.credential.clear-text-fallback</name> <value>false</value> <description> true or false to indicate whether or not to fall back to storing credential password as clear text. The default value is true. This property only works when the password can't not be found from credential providers. </description> </property>
Once set, all configuration options looked up via the getPassword()
API must be served via a credential provider.
