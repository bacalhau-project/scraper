Designed to redefine the way we approach fast, cost-effective and secure computation, Bacalhau is rooted in community-driven advancements. Centered on executing tasks precisely where data is generated and stored, Bacalhau integrates seamlessly with existing Docker and WebAssembly (WASM) workflows. This strategy, called Compute Over Data (CoD), is set to revolutionize large-scale dataset processing.Problems enterprises face today.Large-scale data challenges:VOLUMEIndividual devices generating or storing over 100GB might seem manageable. But when you scale this up to 10, 100, or even thousands of devices, the data volume can quickly reach terabytes or petabytes. This sheer volume can be challenging for traditional storage and processing systems to handle.VELOCITY​Devices, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, can generate data at an incredibly fast rate. This rapid data generation can strain the ingestion capabilities of traditional systems.VARIETY​Data from different devices can come in various formats. Some might produce structured data, while others might produce unstructured or semi-structured data. Managing this variety can be complex.VERACITYWith the increase in the number of devices, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of data becomes a challenge.ImplicationsBOTTLENECKSTraditional computing systems, which are not designed to handle such vast amounts of data, can experience bottlenecks in both storage and processing. This can lead to slow query performances, lag in data analysis, and overall system inefficiencies.INCREASED COSTSManaging vast amounts of data requires more storage, more processing power, and more bandwidth. This can lead to increased infrastructure and operational costs.SECURITY CONCERNSWith more devices connected and generating data, there’s an expanded surface area for potential security breaches.DATA LOSSTraditional systems might not be equipped with the necessary backup and recovery solutions for such vast amounts of data, leading to potential data loss.How Bacalhau solves those challenges:Distributed Computing SolutionBacalhau offers a solution for these data-intensive problems by using distributed computing. Managing data close to where it’s generated or stored enhances processing speed, agility and security.
