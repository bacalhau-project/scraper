It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch.  You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.The following documents describe concepts and procedures to get you started using ZooKeeper.
