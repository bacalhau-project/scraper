Test Network Locally
Before you join the main Bacalhau network, you can test locally.
To test, you can use the bacalhau devstack
command, which offers a way to get a 3 node cluster running locally.
By settings PREDICTABLE_API_PORT=1
, the first node of our 3 node cluster will always listen on port 20000
In another window, export the following environment variables so that the Bacalhau client binary connects to our local development cluster:
You can now interact with Bacalhau - all jobs are running by the local devstack cluster.
