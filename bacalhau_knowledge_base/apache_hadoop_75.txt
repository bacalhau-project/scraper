All HDFS commands are invoked by the bin/hdfs
script. Running the hdfs script without any arguments prints the description for all commands.
Usage: hdfs [SHELL_OPTIONS] COMMAND [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]
Hadoop has an option parsing framework that employs parsing generic options as well as running classes.
COMMAND_OPTIONS | Description |
---|---|
SHELL_OPTIONS | The common set of shell options. These are documented on the
|
Commands useful for users of a hadoop cluster.
classpath
Usage: hdfs classpath [--glob |--jar <path> |-h |--help]
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|

Prints the class path needed to get the Hadoop jar and the required libraries. If called without arguments, then prints the classpath set up by the command scripts, which is likely to contain wildcards in the classpath entries. Additional options print the classpath after wildcard expansion or write the classpath into the manifest of a jar file. The latter is useful in environments where wildcards cannot be used and the expanded classpath exceeds the maximum supported command line length.

Runs a cluster balancing utility. An administrator can simply press Ctrl-C to stop the rebalancing process. See [Balancer](./HdfsUserGuide.html#Balancer) for more details.
Note that the blockpool
policy is stricter than the datanode
policy.
Besides the above command options, a pinning feature is introduced starting from 2.7.0 to prevent certain replicas from getting moved by balancer/mover. This pinning feature is disabled by default, and can be enabled by configuration property “dfs.datanode.block-pinning.enabled”. When enabled, this feature only affects blocks that are written to favored nodes specified in the create() call. This feature is useful when we want to maintain the data locality, for applications such as HBase regionserver.
If you want to run Balancer as a long-running service, please start Balancer using -asService
parameter with daemon-mode. You can do this by using the following command: hdfs --daemon start balancer -asService
, or just use sbin/start-balancer.sh script with parameter -asService
.

Usage:
hdfs dfsadmin [-report [-live] [-dead] [-decommissioning] [-enteringmaintenance] [-inmaintenance] [-slownodes]] hdfs dfsadmin [-safemode enter | leave | get | wait | forceExit] hdfs dfsadmin [-saveNamespace [-beforeShutdown]] hdfs dfsadmin [-rollEdits] hdfs dfsadmin [-restoreFailedStorage true |false |check] hdfs dfsadmin [-refreshNodes] hdfs dfsadmin [-setQuota <quota> <dirname>...<dirname>] hdfs dfsadmin [-clrQuota <dirname>...<dirname>] hdfs dfsadmin [-setSpaceQuota <quota> [-storageType <storagetype>] <dirname>...<dirname>] hdfs dfsadmin [-clrSpaceQuota [-storageType <storagetype>] <dirname>...<dirname>] hdfs dfsadmin [-finalizeUpgrade] hdfs dfsadmin [-rollingUpgrade [<query> |<prepare> |<finalize>]] hdfs dfsadmin [-upgrade [query | finalize] hdfs dfsadmin [-refreshServiceAcl] hdfs dfsadmin [-refreshUserToGroupsMappings] hdfs dfsadmin [-refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration] hdfs dfsadmin [-refreshCallQueue] hdfs dfsadmin [-refresh <host:ipc_port> <key> [arg1..argn]] hdfs dfsadmin [-reconfig <namenode|datanode> <host:ipc_port|livenodes> <start |status |properties>] hdfs dfsadmin [-printTopology] hdfs dfsadmin [-refreshNamenodes datanodehost:port] hdfs dfsadmin [-getVolumeReport datanodehost:port] hdfs dfsadmin [-deleteBlockPool datanode-host:port blockpoolId [force]] hdfs dfsadmin [-setBalancerBandwidth <bandwidth in bytes per second>] hdfs dfsadmin [-getBalancerBandwidth <datanode_host:ipc_port>] hdfs dfsadmin [-fetchImage <local directory>] hdfs dfsadmin [-allowSnapshot <snapshotDir>] hdfs dfsadmin [-disallowSnapshot <snapshotDir>] hdfs dfsadmin [-shutdownDatanode <datanode_host:ipc_port> [upgrade]] hdfs dfsadmin [-evictWriters <datanode_host:ipc_port>] hdfs dfsadmin [-getDatanodeInfo <datanode_host:ipc_port>] hdfs dfsadmin [-metasave filename] hdfs dfsadmin [-triggerBlockReport [-incremental] <datanode_host:ipc_port> [-namenode <namenode_host:ipc_port>]] hdfs dfsadmin [-listOpenFiles [-blockingDecommission] [-path <path>]] hdfs dfsadmin [-help [cmd]]
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|
-report [-live] [-dead] [-decommissioning] [-enteringmaintenance] [-inmaintenance] [-slownodes] |
Reports basic filesystem information and statistics, The dfs usage can be different from “du” usage, because it measures raw space used by replication, checksums, snapshots and etc. on all the DNs. Optional flags may be used to filter the list of displayed DataNodes. Filters are either based on the DN state (e.g. live, dead, decommissioning) or the nature of the DN (e.g. slow nodes - nodes with higher latency than their peers). |
-safemode enter|leave|get|wait|forceExit |
Safe mode maintenance command. Safe mode is a Namenode state in which it 1. does not accept changes to the name space (read-only) 2. does not replicate or delete blocks. Safe mode is entered automatically at Namenode startup, and leaves safe mode automatically when the configured minimum percentage of blocks satisfies the minimum replication condition. If Namenode detects any anomaly then it will linger in safe mode till that issue is resolved. If that anomaly is the consequence of a deliberate action, then administrator can use -safemode forceExit to exit safe mode. The cases where forceExit may be required are 1. Namenode metadata is not consistent. If Namenode detects that metadata has been modified out of band and can cause data loss, then Namenode will enter forceExit state. At that point user can either restart Namenode with correct metadata files or forceExit (if data loss is acceptable). 2. Rollback causes metadata to be replaced and rarely it can trigger safe mode forceExit state in Namenode. In that case you may proceed by issuing -safemode forceExit. Safe mode can also be entered manually, but then it can only be turned off manually as well. |
-saveNamespace [-beforeShutdown] |
Save current namespace into storage directories and reset edits log. Requires safe mode. If the “beforeShutdown” option is given, the NameNode does a checkpoint if and only if no checkpoint has been done during a time window (a configurable number of checkpoint periods). This is usually used before shutting down the NameNode to prevent potential fsimage/editlog corruption. |
-rollEdits |
Rolls the edit log on the active NameNode. |
-restoreFailedStorage true|false|check |
This option will turn on/off automatic attempt to restore failed storage replicas. If a failed storage becomes available again the system will attempt to restore edits and/or fsimage during checkpoint. ‘check’ option will return current setting. |
-refreshNodes |
Re-read the hosts and exclude files to update the set of Datanodes that are allowed to connect to the Namenode and those that should be decommissioned or recommissioned. |

-geteditsize |
Prints the number of uncheckpointed transactions on the NameNode. |
Runs the HDFS secondary namenode. See [Secondary Namenode](./HdfsUserGuide.html#Secondary_NameNode) for more info.
storagepolicies
Usage:
hdfs storagepolicies [-listPolicies] [-setStoragePolicy -path <path> -policy <policy>] [-getStoragePolicy -path <path>] [-unsetStoragePolicy -path <path>] [-satisfyStoragePolicy -path <path>] [-isSatisfierRunning] [-help <command-name>]
Lists out all/Gets/sets/unsets storage policies. See the [HDFS Storage Policy Documentation](./ArchivalStorage.html) for more information.
zkfc
Usage: hdfs zkfc [-formatZK [-force] [-nonInteractive]]
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|
-formatZK |
Format the Zookeeper instance. -force: formats the znode if the znode exists. -nonInteractive: formats the znode aborts if the znode exists, unless -force option is specified. |
-h |
Display help |
This command starts a Zookeeper Failover Controller process for use with [HDFS HA with QJM](./HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.html#Administrative_commands).
Useful commands to help administrators debug HDFS issues. These commands are for advanced users only.
verifyMeta
Usage: hdfs debug verifyMeta -meta <metadata-file> [-block <block-file>]
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|
-block block-file |
Optional parameter to specify the absolute path for the block file on the local file system of the data node. |
-meta metadata-file |
Absolute path for the metadata file on the local file system of the data node. |
Verify HDFS metadata and block files. If a block file is specified, we will verify that the checksums in the metadata file match the block file.
computeMeta
Usage: hdfs debug computeMeta -block <block-file> -out <output-metadata-file>
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|
-block block-file |
Absolute path for the block file on the local file system of the data node. |
-out output-metadata-file |
Absolute path for the output metadata file to store the checksum computation result from the block file. |
Compute HDFS metadata from block files. If a block file is specified, we will compute the checksums from the block file, and save it to the specified output metadata file.
NOTE: Use at your own risk! If the block file is corrupt and you overwrite it’s meta file, it will show up as ‘good’ in HDFS, but you can’t read the data. Only use as a last measure, and when you are 100% certain the block file is good.
recoverLease
Usage: hdfs debug recoverLease -path <path> [-retries <num-retries>]
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|
[-path path] |
HDFS path for which to recover the lease. |
[-retries num-retries] |
Number of times the client will retry calling recoverLease. The default number of retries is 1. |
Recover the lease on the specified path. The path must reside on an HDFS file system. The default number of retries is 1.
verifyEC
Usage: hdfs debug verifyEC -file <file>
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|
[-file EC-file] |
HDFS EC file to be verified. |
Verify the correctness of erasure coding on an erasure coded file.
Usage: hdfs dfsadmin -fs <child fs mount link URI> <dfsadmin command options>
COMMAND_OPTION | Description |
---|---|
-fs child fs mount link URI |
Its a logical mount link path to child file system in ViewFS world. This uri typically formed as src mount link prefixed with fs.defaultFS. Please note, this is not an actual child file system uri, instead its a logical mount link uri pointing to actual child file system |
Example command usage: hdfs dfsadmin -fs hdfs://nn1 -safemode enter
In ViewFsOverloadScheme, we may have multiple child file systems as mount point mappings as shown in [ViewFsOverloadScheme Guide](./ViewFsOverloadScheme.html). Here -fs option is an optional generic parameter supported by dfsadmin. When users want to execute commands on one of the child file system, they need to pass that file system mount mapping link uri to -fs option. Let’s take an example mount link configuration and dfsadmin command below.
Mount link:
<property> <name>fs.defaultFS</name> <value>hdfs://MyCluster1</value> </property> <property> <name>fs.viewfs.mounttable.MyCluster1./user</name> <value>hdfs://MyCluster2/user</value> <!-- mount table name : MyCluster1 mount link mapping: hdfs://MyCluster1/user --> hdfs://MyCluster2/user mount link path: /user mount link uri: hdfs://MyCluster1/user mount target uri for /user: hdfs://MyCluster2/user --> </property>
If user wants to talk to hdfs://MyCluster2/
, then they can pass -fs option (-fs hdfs://MyCluster1/user
) Since /user was mapped to a cluster hdfs://MyCluster2/user
, dfsadmin resolve the passed (-fs hdfs://MyCluster1/user
) to target fs (hdfs://MyCluster2/user
). This way users can get the access to all hdfs child file systems in ViewFsOverloadScheme. If there is no -fs
option provided, then it will try to connect to the configured fs.defaultFS cluster if a cluster running with the fs.defaultFS uri.
