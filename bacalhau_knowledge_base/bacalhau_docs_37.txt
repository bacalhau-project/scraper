Limits and Timeouts
Resource Limits
These are the flags that control the capacity of the Bacalhau node, and the limits for jobs that might be run.
The --limit-total-*
flags control the total system resources you want to give to the network. If left blank, the system will attempt to detect these values automatically.
The --limit-job-*
flags control the maximum amount of resources a single job can consume for it to be selected for execution.
Resource limits are not supported for Docker jobs running on Windows. Resource limits will be applied at the job bid stage based on reported job requirements but will be silently unenforced. Jobs will be able to access as many resources as requested at runtime.[](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/running-node/resource-limits#windows-support)
Windows Support
Running a Windows-based node is not officially supported, so your mileage may vary. Some features (like [resource limits](/setting-up/running-node/resource-limits#resource-limits)) are not present in Windows-based nodes.
Bacalhau currently makes the assumption that all containers are Linux-based. Users of the Docker executor will need to manually ensure that their Docker engine is running and [configured appropriately](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) to support Linux containers, e.g. using the WSL-based backend.[](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/running-node/resource-limits#timeouts)
Timeouts
Bacalhau can limit the total time a job spends executing. A job that spends too long executing will be cancelled, and no results will be published.
By default, a Bacalhau node does not enforce any limit on job execution time. Both node operators and job submitters can supply a maximum execution time limit. If a job submitter asks for a longer execution time than permitted by a node operator, their job will be rejected.
Applying job timeouts allows node operators to more fairly distribute the work submitted to their nodes. It also protects users from transient errors that result in their jobs waiting indefinitely.[](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/running-node/resource-limits#configuring-execution-time-limits-for-a-job)
Configuring Execution Time Limits
Job submitters can pass the --timeout
flag to any Bacalhau job submission CLI to set a maximum job execution time. The supplied value should be a whole number of seconds with no unit.
The timeout can also be added to an existing job spec by adding the Timeout
property to the Spec
.
