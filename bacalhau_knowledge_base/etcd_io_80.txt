platformsVersionsv3.6-DRAFTOperations guideSupported platformsSupported platformsetcd support for common architectures & operating systemsSupport tiersetcd runs on different platforms, but the guarantees it provides depends on a
platform’s support tier:Tier 1: fully supported byetcd maintainers; etcd is guaranteed to
pass all tests including functional and robustness tests.Tier 2: etcd is guaranteed to pass integration and end-to-end tests but
not necessarily functional or robustness tests.Tier 3: etcd is guaranteed to build, may be lightly tested (or not), and
so it should be consideredunstable.Current supportThe following table lists currently supported platforms and their corresponding
etcd support tier:ArchitectureOperating systemSupport tierMaintainersAMD64Linux1etcd maintainersARM64Linux1etcd maintainersAMD64Darwin3AMD64Windows3ARMLinux3386Linux3ppc64leLinux3s390xLinux3Unlisted platforms are unsupported.Supporting a new platformWant to contribute to etcd as the “official” maintainer of a new platform? In
addition to committing to support the platform, you must setup etcd continuous
integration (CI) satisfying the following requirements, depending on the support
tier:etcd continuous integrationTier 1Tier 2Tier 3Build passes✓✓✓Unit tests pass✓✓Integration and end-to-end tests pass✓✓Robustness tests pass✓For an example of setting up tier-2 CI for ARM64, seeetcd PR #12928.Unsupported platformsTo avoid inadvertently running an etcd server on an unsupported platform, etcd
prints a warning message and exits immediately unless the environment variableETCD_UNSUPPORTED_ARCHis set to the target architecture.32-bit systemsetcd hasknown issueson 32-bit systems due to a bug in the Go runtime.
