onenode, often in areplicatedfashion.[1]It is usually specifically used to refer to either adistributed databasewhere users store information on anumber of nodes, or acomputer networkin which users store information on anumber of peer network nodes.[2]Distributed databases[edit]Distributed databasesare usuallynon-relational databasesthat enable a quick access to data over a large number of nodes. Some distributed databases expose rich query abilities while others are limited to akey-value storesemantics. Examples of limited distributed databases areGoogle'sBigtable, which is much more than adistributed file systemor apeer-to-peer network,[3]Amazon'sDynamo[4]andMicrosoft Azure Storage.[5]As the ability of arbitrary querying is not as important as theavailability, designers of distributed data stores have increased the latter at an expense of consistency. But the high-speed read/write access results in reduced consistency, as it is not possible to guarantee bothconsistencyand availability on a partitioned network, as stated by theCAP theorem.Peer network node data stores[edit]In peer network data stores, the user can usually reciprocate and allow other users to use their computer as a storage node as well. Information may or may not be accessible to other users depending on the design of the network.Mostpeer-to-peernetworks do not have distributed data stores in that the user's data is only available when their node is on the network. However, this distinction is somewhat blurred in a system such asBitTorrent, where it is possible for the originating node to go offline but the content to continue to be served. Still, this is only the case for individual files requested by the redistributors, as contrasted with networks such asFreenet,Winny,ShareandPerfect Darkwhere any node may be storing any part of the files on the network.Distributed data stores typically use anerror detection and correctiontechnique.
Some distributed data stores (such asParchiveover NNTP) useforward error correctiontechniques to recover the original file when parts of that file are damaged or unavailable.
Others try again to download that file from a different mirror.Examples[edit]Distributed non-relational databases[edit]ProductLicenseHigh availabilityNotesApache AccumuloAL2AerospikeAGPLApache CassandraAL2Yesformerly used byFacebookApache IgniteAL2BigtableProprietaryused byGoogleCouchbaseAL2used byLinkedIn,PayPal, andeBayCrateDBAL2YesApache DruidAL2used byNetflix, andYahooDynamoProprietaryused byAmazonetcdAL2YesHazelcastAL2, ProprietaryHBaseAL2Yesformerly used by FacebookHypertableGPL 2BaiduMongoDBSSPLMySQL NDB ClusterGPL 2YesSQL and NoSQL APIsRiakAL2YesRedisBSD LicenseYesScyllaDBAGPLVoldemortAL2used byLinkedInPeer network node data stores[edit]BitTorrentBlockchain (database)Chord projectFreenetGNUnetIPFSMnetNapsterNNTP(the distributed data storage protocol used forUsenetnews)Unity, of the softwarePerfect DarkShareSiacoinDeNetStorage@homeTahoe-LAFSWinnyZeroNetSee also[edit]Cooperative storage cloudData storeKeyspace, the DDSschemaDistributed hash tableDistributed cacheCyber ResilienceReferences[edit]^Yaniv Pessach,Distributed Storage(Distributed Storage: Concepts, Algorithms, and Implementations ed.),OL25423189M^"Distributed Data Storage - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics".^"Bigtable: Google's Distributed Data Store". Paper Trail. Archived fromthe originalon 2017-07-16. Retrieved2011-04-05.Although GFS provides Google with reliable, scalable distributed file storage, it does not provide any facility for structuring the data contained in the files beyond a hierarchical directory structure and meaningful file names. It's well known that more expressive solutions are required for large data sets. Google's terabytes upon terabytes of data that they retrieve from web crawlers, amongst many other sources, need organising, so that client applications can quickly perform lookups and updates at a finer granularity than the file level. [...] The very first thing you need to know about Bigtable is that it isn't a relational database. This should come as no surprise: one persistent theme through all of these large scale distributed data store papers is that RDBMSs are hard to do with good performance. There is no hard, fixed schema in a Bigtable, no referential integrity between tables (so no foreign keys) and therefore little support for optimised joins.^Sarah Pidcock (2011-01-31)."Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store"(PDF).
