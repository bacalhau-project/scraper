Paterson's distinguished career was recognised with theEATCS Awardin 2006, and a workshop in honour of his 66th birthday in 2008, including contributions of severalTuring AwardandGödel Prizelaureates. A further workshop was held in 2017 in honour of his 75th birthday, co-located with the workshop for the 10th anniversary of the DIMAP centre. For his work ondistributed computingwithFischerandLynch, he received theDijkstra Prizein 2001, and his work with Dyer and Goldberg on counting graph homomorphisms received the best paper award at theICALPconference in 2006. Mike Paterson received aLester R. Ford Awardin 2010.[3]He is aFellow of the Royal Societysince 2001 and been president of theEuropean Association for Theoretical Computer Science(EATCS). According to EATCS presidentMaurice Nivat, Paterson played a great role in the late 1960s in the recognition of computer science as a science, "and that theoretical computer science, which is very close to mathematics but distinct in its motivation and inspiration, is indeed a challenging and fruitful field of research."[4]Paterson is also an enthusiasticmountaineer.Selected publications[edit]M.
