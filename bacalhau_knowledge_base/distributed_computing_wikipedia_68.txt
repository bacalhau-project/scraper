However, once it becomes too complex, you can consider refactoring it into microservices or a distributed application. Note that a monolithic application deployed on a single machine, may be performant enough for your current workload but it's less available, less durable, less changeable, less fine-tuned and less scalable than a well designeddistributed system.[4]The design philosophy is that the application is responsible not just for a particular task, but can perform every step needed to complete a particular function.[5]Some personal finance applications are monolithic in the sense that they help the user carry out a complete task, end to end, and areprivate data silosrather than parts of a larger system of applications that work together. Someword processorsare monolithic applications.[6]These applications are sometimes associated withmainframe computers.In software engineering, a monolithic application describes a software application that is designed as a single service.[7]Multiple services can be desirable in certain scenarios as it can facilitate maintenance by allowing repair or replacement of parts of the application without requiring wholesale replacement.Modularity is achieved to various extents by differentmodular programmingapproaches. Code-based modularity allows developers to reuse and repair parts of the application, but development tools are required to perform these maintenance functions (e.g. the application may need to be recompiled). Object-based modularity provides the application as a collection of separate executable files that may be independently maintained and replaced without redeploying the entire application (e.g. Microsoft'sDynamic-link library(DLL); Sun/UNIXshared objectfiles).[8]Some object messaging capabilities allow object-based applications to be distributed across multiple computers (e.g. Microsoft'sComponent Object Model(COM)).Service-oriented architecturesuse specific communication standards/protocols to communicate between modules.[citation needed]In its original use, the term "monolithic" described enormous mainframe applications with no usable modularity.[9]This, in combination with the rapid increase in computational power and therefore rapid increase in the complexity of the problems which could be tackled by software, resulted in unmaintainable systems and the "software crisis".Patterns[edit]Here are commonarchitectural patternsused for monolithic applications, each has its own trade-offs:[3]Layered architectureModularmonolithMicrokernel architectureReferences[edit]^Mishra, Mayank; Kunde, Shruti; Nambiar, Manoj (2018).
