What problem does Expanso solve?
Expanso offers a distributed platform designed to address the challenges associated with working on big data in an increasingly distributed world. The team at Expanso built and leverages the open-source project [Bacalhau](http://bacalhau.org) to make big data processing faster, cheaper, and more secure.
Expanso aims to solve several key problems that organizations face when working with big data:
Some key aspects of the relationship:
- Distributed data: Traditional data systems are centralized, but in today’s world, data is generated across multiple devices and processed in various locations. Expanso ensures that jobs run where the data is created, reducing the need to move raw data, decreasing data transfer costs, and preventing redundant storage.
- Management oversight: Managing and monitoring distributed jobs can be a headache. Expanso not only ensures these jobs run smoothly but also gives users a clear view of the status of all their tasks.

Expanso limits or eliminates data movement altogether and provides detailed audit logs. Additionally, teams can sanitize, filter, or eliminate sensitive data, reducing the likelihood of unintentionally transferring or storing data that can trigger penalties like personally identifiable information (PII).
Who should use Expanso?
Expanso is designed to tackle big data challenges across a spectrum of sectors and applications.
Here are just some of the scenarios where Expanso is valuable:
Some key aspects of the relationship:
- Processing “immobile” data: If you're into data engineering, machine learning, analytics, or scientific computing, where managing petabytes of data is the norm, processing data in place will be required to gain insights quickly and reliably.

- For navigating data privacy & security: Many industries have strict regulatory compliance around data movement. Expanso is built to enable processing over that data with full recognition of the requirements of data gravity.
- Faster information from the edge: With more devices and information coming in from the network fringe, Expanso can help provide real-time analytics and insights on devices, with arbitrary query and execution capabilities.
- Reducing data transfer and storage costs: Expanso offers multiple ways to reduce data transfer and storage costs. By only moving the data required, organizations can reduce the cost in excessive data transfer and storage.
In essence, Bacalhau is your go-to for handling the complexities of distributed big data. And with Expanso backing it, you get the added perks of validated binaries, detailed security build information, and an SLA for business critical support.
How is Expanso being used?
Expanso users and customers are now able to perform:
- Improved Log Management: Companies are using Bacalhau to handle ever expanding application logs. Through Expanso, users not only manage this data but also filters out sensitive information, and allows users to glean insights using SQL queries or regex across different services.
- Machine Learning at the Edge:
- Training: Bacalhau supports machine learning training directly on remote edge devices, reducing the need for centralization of all data before building a model.
- Inference: Models are sent to edge devices for accurate real-time predictions. The platform handles both batch and long-running inference tasks, including allowing for data pre-processing, and enabling regular model updates.
- Distributed Data Warehousing: By acting as an intermediary, Bacalhau can run SQL queries over multiple data sources, essentially crafting a unified virtual data warehouse.
- Infrastructure Insight: Organizations are tapping into OSQuery through Bacalhau to conduct on-the-spot queries on devices and machines. This capability is further boosted with the ability to execute arbitrary commands on these devices without requiring remote shell access, enabling more and reliable fleet monitoring and management.
- Tackling Geographically Distributed Data Files: For enterprises with files scattered across different zones, regions, or cloud providers, Bacalhau allows data processing close to geographically distributed buckets. This accelerates traditional ETL processes, leading to quicker insights and improved data management.
- Resilient in Complex Networking Environments: In topologies such as edge or IoT where network connections are unstable, Bacalhau ensures that jobs are executed without reliable, courtesy of Bacalhau’s decentralized queuing and coordination.
Cross-Organizational Machine Learning: In industries where data regulations prevent sharing of data even for just model training, organizations lose out on the ability to group data together for more accurate models. With Bacalhau, teams can collaborate and train models, while providing audit logs and restricted permissions, enabling stringent data oversight, and without the need to exchange raw data.
