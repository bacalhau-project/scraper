evictionMaxPodGracePeriod int32 | evictionMaxPodGracePeriod is the maximum allowed grace period (in seconds) to use when terminating pods in response to a soft eviction threshold being met. This value effectively caps the Pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds value during soft evictions. Note: Due to issue #64530, the behavior has a bug where this value currently just overrides the grace period during soft eviction, which can increase the grace period from what is set on the Pod. This bug will be fixed in a future release. Default: 0 |

Default: "Watch" |
systemReserved map[string]string | systemReserved is a set of ResourceName=ResourceQuantity (e.g. cpu=200m,memory=150G) pairs that describe resources reserved for non-kubernetes components. Currently only cpu and memory are supported. See http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources for more detail. Default: nil |
kubeReserved map[string]string | kubeReserved is a set of ResourceName=ResourceQuantity (e.g. cpu=200m,memory=150G) pairs that describe resources reserved for kubernetes system components.

meta/v1.Duration | shutdownGracePeriod specifies the total duration that the node should delay the shutdown and total grace period for pod termination during a node shutdown. Default: "0s" |
shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods
meta/v1.Duration | shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods specifies the duration used to terminate critical pods during a node shutdown. This should be less than shutdownGracePeriod. For example, if shutdownGracePeriod=30s, and shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods=10s, during a node shutdown the first 20 seconds would be reserved for gracefully terminating normal pods, and the last 10 seconds would be reserved for terminating critical pods. Default: "0s" |
shutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority
[]ShutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority | shutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority specifies the shutdown grace period for Pods based on their associated priority class value. When a shutdown request is received, the Kubelet will initiate shutdown on all pods running on the node with a grace period that depends on the priority of the pod, and then wait for all pods to exit. Each entry in the array represents the graceful shutdown time a pod with a priority class value that lies in the range of that value and the next higher entry in the list when the node is shutting down. For example, to allow critical pods 10s to shutdown, priority>=10000 pods 20s to shutdown, and all remaining pods 30s to shutdown. shutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority:
The time the Kubelet will wait before exiting will at most be the maximum of all shutdownGracePeriodSeconds for each priority class range represented on the node. When all pods have exited or reached their grace periods, the Kubelet will release the shutdown inhibit lock. Requires the GracefulNodeShutdown feature gate to be enabled. This configuration must be empty if either ShutdownGracePeriod or ShutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods is set. Default: nil |
reservedMemory
[]MemoryReservation | reservedMemory specifies a comma-separated list of memory reservations for NUMA nodes.
The parameter makes sense only in the context of the memory manager feature.
The memory manager will not allocate reserved memory for container workloads.
For example, if you have a NUMA0 with 10Gi of memory and the reservedMemory was
specified to reserve 1Gi of memory at NUMA0, the memory manager will assume that
only 9Gi is available for allocation.
You can specify a different amount of NUMA node and memory types.
You can omit this parameter at all, but you should be aware that the amount of
reserved memory from all NUMA nodes should be equal to the amount of memory specified
by the
Default: nil |
enableProfilingHandler bool | enableProfilingHandler enables profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/ Default: true |
enableDebugFlagsHandler bool | enableDebugFlagsHandler enables flags endpoint via web interface host:port/debug/flags/v Default: true |
seccompDefault bool | SeccompDefault enables the use of |
memoryThrottlingFactor float64 | MemoryThrottlingFactor specifies the factor multiplied by the memory limit or node allocatable memory when setting the cgroupv2 memory.high value to enforce MemoryQoS. Decreasing this factor will set lower high limit for container cgroups and put heavier reclaim pressure while increasing will put less reclaim pressure. See https://kep.k8s.io/2570 for more details. Default: 0.9 |
registerWithTaints
[]core/v1.Taint | registerWithTaints are an array of taints to add to a node object when the kubelet registers itself. This only takes effect when registerNode is true and upon the initial registration of the node. Default: nil |
registerNode bool | registerNode enables automatic registration with the apiserver. Default: true |
tracing
TracingConfiguration | Tracing specifies the versioned configuration for OpenTelemetry tracing clients. See https://kep.k8s.io/2832 for more details. Default: nil |
localStorageCapacityIsolation bool | LocalStorageCapacityIsolation enables local ephemeral storage isolation feature. The default setting is true. This feature allows users to set request/limit for container's ephemeral storage and manage it in a similar way as cpu and memory. It also allows setting sizeLimit for emptyDir volume, which will trigger pod eviction if disk usage from the volume exceeds the limit. This feature depends on the capability of detecting correct root file system disk usage. For certain systems, such as kind rootless, if this capability cannot be supported, the feature LocalStorageCapacityIsolation should be disabled. Once disabled, user should not set request/limit for container's ephemeral storage, or sizeLimit for emptyDir. Default: true |
containerRuntimeEndpoint [Required]string | ContainerRuntimeEndpoint is the endpoint of container runtime. Unix Domain Sockets are supported on Linux, while npipe and tcp endpoints are supported on Windows. Examples:'unix:///path/to/runtime.sock', 'npipe:////./pipe/runtime' |
imageServiceEndpoint string | ImageServiceEndpoint is the endpoint of container image service. Unix Domain Socket are supported on Linux, while npipe and tcp endpoints are supported on Windows. Examples:'unix:///path/to/runtime.sock', 'npipe:////./pipe/runtime'. If not specified, the value in containerRuntimeEndpoint is used. |
failCgroupV1 bool | FailCgroupV1 prevents the kubelet from starting on hosts that use cgroup v1. By default, this is set to 'false', meaning the kubelet is allowed to start on cgroup v1 hosts unless this option is explicitly enabled. Default: false |
SerializedNodeConfigSource
SerializedNodeConfigSource allows us to serialize v1.NodeConfigSource. This type is used internally by the Kubelet for tracking checkpointed dynamic configs. It exists in the kubeletconfig API group because it is classified as a versioned input to the Kubelet.

Field | Description |
---|---|
name [Required]string | name is the required name of the credential provider. It must match the name of the provider executable as seen by the kubelet. The executable must be in the kubelet's bin directory (set by the --image-credential-provider-bin-dir flag). |
matchImages [Required][]string | matchImages is a required list of strings used to match against images in order to determine if this provider should be invoked. If one of the strings matches the requested image from the kubelet, the plugin will be invoked and given a chance to provide credentials. Images are expected to contain the registry domain and URL path. Each entry in matchImages is a pattern which can optionally contain a port and a path. Globs can be used in the domain, but not in the port or the path. Globs are supported as subdomains like '.k8s.io' or 'k8s..io', and top-level-domains such as 'k8s.'. Matching partial subdomains like 'app.k8s.io' is also supported. Each glob can only match a single subdomain segment, so *.io does not match *.k8s.io. A match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true:
