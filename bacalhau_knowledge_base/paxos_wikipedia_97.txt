Fischer did hisMAandPhDstudies inapplied mathematicsatHarvard University; he received his MA degree in 1965 and PhD in 1968. Fischer's PhD supervisor at Harvard wasSheila Greibach.Career[edit]After receiving his PhD, Fischer was an assistant professor of computer science atCarnegie Mellon Universityin 1968–1969, an assistant professor of mathematics atMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) in 1969–1973, and an associate professor ofelectrical engineeringat MIT in 1973–1975. At MIT he supervised doctoral students who became prominent computer scientists, includingDavid S. Johnson,Frances Yao, andMichael Hammer.In 1975, Fischer was nominated as a professor ofcomputer scienceat theUniversity of Washington. Since 1981, he has been a professor of computer science atYale University, where his students includedRebecca N. Wright. Fischer served as the editor-in-chief of theJournal of the ACMin 1982–1986.[1][2]He was inducted as a Fellow of theAssociation for Computing Machinery(ACM) in 1996.[3]Work[edit]Distributed computing[edit]Fischer's 1985 work withNancy A. LynchandMichael S. Paterson[4]onconsensus problemsreceived thePODC Influential-Paper Awardin 2001.[5]Their work showed that in an asynchronous distributed system, consensus is impossible if there is one processor that crashes.Jennifer Welchwrites that “This result has had a monumental impact in distributed computing, both theory and practice. Systems designers were motivated to clarify their claims concerning under what circumstances the systems work.”[5]Fischer was the program chairman of the firstSymposium on Principles of Distributed Computing(PODC) in 1982;[6]nowadays, PODC is the leading conference in the field. In 2003, the distributed computing community honoured Fischer's 60th birthday by organising a lecture series during the 22nd PODC,[7]withLeslie Lamport, Nancy Lynch,Albert R. Meyer, and Rebecca Wright as speakers.Parallel computing[edit]In 1980, Fischer andRichard E. Ladner[8]presented aparallel algorithmfor computingprefix sumsefficiently. They show how to construct a circuit that computes the prefix sums; in the circuit, each node performs an addition of two numbers. With their construction, one can choose a trade-off between the circuit depth and the number of nodes.[9]However, the same circuit designs were already studied much earlier bySovietmathematicians.[10][11]Algorithms and computational complexity[edit]Fischer has done multifaceted work in theoretical computer science in general. Fischer's early work, including his PhD thesis, focused onparsingandformal grammars.[12]One of Fischer's most-cited works deals withstring matching.[13]Already during his years at Michigan, Fischer studieddisjoint-set data structurestogether withBernard Galler.[14]Cryptography[edit]Fischer is one of the pioneers inelectronic voting. In 1985, Fischer and his student Josh Cohen Benaloh[15]presented one of the first electronic voting schemes.[16]Other contributions related to cryptography include the study ofkey exchangeproblems and a protocol foroblivious transfer.[16]In 1984, Fischer,Silvio Micali, andCharles Rackoff[17]presented an improved version ofMichael O. Rabin's protocol for oblivious transfer.Publications[edit]Galler, Bernard A.; Fischer, Michael J.
