Open Source NoSQL Database
Manage massive amounts of data, fast, without losing sleep
What is Apache Cassandra
?
Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
Hybrid
Masterless architecture and low latency means Cassandra will withstand an entire data center outage with no data loss—across public or private clouds and on-premises.
Fault Tolerant
Cassandra’s support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime.
Focus on Quality
To ensure reliability and stability, Cassandra is tested on clusters as large as 1,000 nodes and with hundreds of real world use cases and schemas tested with replay, fuzz, property-based, fault-injection, and performance tests.
Performant
Cassandra [consistently outperforms](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdf) popular NoSQL alternatives in benchmarks and real applications, primarily because of fundamental architectural choices.
You’re In Control
Choose between synchronous or asynchronous replication for each update. Highly available asynchronous operations are optimized with features like Hinted Handoff and Read Repair.
Security and Observability
The audit logging feature for operators tracks the DML, DDL, and DCL activity with minimal impact to normal workload performance, while the fqltool allows the capture and replay of production workloads for analysis.
Distributed
Cassandra is suitable for applications that can’t afford to lose data, even when an entire data center goes down. There are no single points of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical.
Scalable
Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.
Elastic
Cassandra streams data between nodes during scaling operations such as adding a new node or datacenter during peak traffic times. Zero Copy Streaming makes this up to 5x faster without vnodes for a more elastic architecture particularly in cloud and Kubernetes environments.
Cassandra Users
Cassandra is used by thousands of companies with large active data sets.
Cassandra Ecosystem
Our ecosystem includes a range of third-party Cassandra projects, tools, products, and services that may be useful to end users.
Community Spotlight
Here’s what the Cassandra community has been doing to advance the world’s premier open source NoSQL database.
Behind the scenes of an Apache Cassandra Release
Formalizing how we balance the need to evolve and provide cutting-edge features with long-term stability. The simple rules we use to decide when to merge and why we’ll be supporting three GA releases going forward, but why we’ve decided to support four releases for the next cycle.

Tightening Security for Apache Cassandra: Part 1
The growth in ecommerce has demanded a greater focus on data security. This is the start of a mini-series by Maulin Vasavada on how to customize SSL/TLS configurations to tighten security in Cassandra 4.0+.

Inside Cassandra: an interview with Marcel Birkner at Instana
A new series that we’ve dubbed "Inside Cassandra" where we interview engineers and devs in the community either about their use of Apache Cassandra to power their businesses or how they contribute to the project. The first installation features an interview with Marcel Birkner, Site Reliability Engineer at Instana, and how they use Apache Cassandra to store and process metric data at scale and benefit from Cassandra’s fault tolerance, and have learned the importance of dog-fooding.
