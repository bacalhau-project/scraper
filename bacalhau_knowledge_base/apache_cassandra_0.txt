Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.HybridMasterless architecture and low latency means Cassandra will withstand an entire data center outage with no data lossâacross public or private clouds and on-premises.Fault TolerantCassandra’s support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime.Focus on QualityTo ensure reliability and stability, Cassandra is tested on clusters as large as 1,000 nodes and with hundreds of real world use cases and schemas tested with replay, fuzz, property-based, fault-injection, and performance tests.PerformantCassandraconsistently outperformspopular NoSQL alternatives in benchmarks and real applications, primarily because of fundamental architectural choices.You’re In ControlChoose between synchronous or asynchronous replication for each update. Highly available asynchronous operations are optimized with features like Hinted Handoff and Read Repair.Security and ObservabilityThe audit logging feature for operators tracks the DML, DDL, and DCL activity with minimal impact to normal workload performance, while the fqltool allows the capture and replay of production workloads for analysis.DistributedCassandra is suitable for applications that can’t afford to lose data, even when an entire data center goes down. There are no single points of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical.ScalableRead and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.ElasticCassandra streams data between nodes during scaling operations such as adding a new node or datacenter during peak traffic times. Zero Copy Streaming makes this up to 5x faster without vnodes for a more elastic architecture particularly in cloud and Kubernetes environments.Cassandra UsersCassandra is used by thousands of companies with large active data sets."Netflix uses Apache Cassandra heavily to satisfy its ever-growing persistence needs on its mission to entertain the world. We have been experimenting and partially using the 4.0 beta in our environments and its features like Audit Logging and backpressure."*â Vinay Chella, Netflix Engineering Manager *âHumankind is at a pivotal point in history, that requires us to work together to find new innovative ways to process the petabytes of data we create every day, and the WitFoo R&D team has found a friend in Cassandra through our endeavors to meet big-data needs in cybersecurity operations.â*â Charles Herring, CTO of WitFoo *"Since 2016, application engineers at Bloomberg have turned to Cassandra because itâs easy to use, easy to scale, and always available. We serve up more than 20 billion requests per day on a nearly 1 PB dataset across a fleet of 1,700+ Cassandra nodes."â Isaac Reath, Software Engineering Team Lead, NoSQL Infrastructure at Bloomberg"We needed something that would handle really high write throughput and keep scaling on the write throughput. That forced us to look at distributed stores, and Apache Cassandra was the option that fitted what we needed."â Elliott Sims Senior Systems Administrator, BackblazeRead Case StudiesCassandra EcosystemOur ecosystem includes a range of third-party Cassandra projects, tools, products, and services that may be useful to end users.Go to EcosystemCommunity SpotlightHere’s what the Cassandra community has been doing to advance the world’s premier open source NoSQL database.Behind the scenes of an Apache Cassandra ReleaseFormalizing how we balance the need to evolve and provide cutting-edge features with long-term stability. The simple rules we use to decide when to merge and why weâll be supporting three GA releases going forward, but why weâve decided to support four releases for the next cycle.Read MoreTightening Security for Apache Cassandra: Part 1The growth in ecommerce has demanded a greater focus on data security. This is the start of a mini-series by Maulin Vasavada on how to customize SSL/TLS configurations to tighten security in Cassandra 4.0+.Read MoreInside Cassandra: an interview with Marcel Birkner at InstanaA new series that we’ve dubbed "Inside Cassandra" where we interview engineers and devs in the community either about their use of Apache Cassandra to power their businesses or how they contribute to the project. The first installation features an interview with Marcel Birkner, Site Reliability Engineer at Instana, and how they use Apache Cassandra to store and process metric data at scale and benefit from Cassandraâs fault tolerance, and have learned the importance of dog-fooding.Read MoreUpcoming ASF EventsJoin the Cassandra community at the next ASF event.Get started with Cassandra, fast.Quickstart GuideApache Cassandrapowers mission-critical deployments with improved performance and unparalleled levels of scale in the cloud.HomeCassandra BasicsQuickstartEcosystemDocumentationCommunityCase StudiesResourcesBlogFoundationEventsLicenseThanksSecurityPrivacySponsorshipÂ© 2009-The Apache Software Foundationunder the terms of the Apache License 2.0.
