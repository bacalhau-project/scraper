are listed athttps://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issuesand are identified with labels. For example, an issue that is identified
as a bug will eventually be set to labelarea/bug. New issues will
start out without any labels, but typicallyetcdmaintainers and active contributors
add labels based on their findings. The detailed list of labels can be found athttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labelsFollowing are few predetermined searches on issues for convenience:BugsHelp WantedLongest untriaged issuesIssue Triage MeetingScopeThese guidelines serves as a primary document for triaging an incoming issues inetcd. Everyone is welcome to help manage issues and PRs but the work and responsibilities discussed in this document are created withetcdmaintainers and active contributors in mind.Validate if an issue is a bugValidate if the issue is indeed a bug. If not, add a comment with findings and close trivial issue. For non-trivial issue, wait to hear back from issue reporter and see if there is any objection. If issue reporter does not reply in 30 days, close the issue. If the problem can not be reproduced or require more information, leave a comment for the issue reporter.Inactive issuesIssues that lack enough information from the issue reporter should be closed if issue reporter do not provide information in 60 days.Duplicate issuesIf an issue is a duplicate, add a comment stating so along with a reference for the original issue and close it.Issues that donâ€™t belong to etcdSometime issues are reported that actually belongs to other projects thatetcduse. For example,grpcorgolangissues. Such issues should be addressed by asking reporter to open issues in appropriate other project. Close the issue unless a maintainer and issue reporter see a need to keep it open for tracking purpose.Verify important labels are in placeMake sure that issue has label on areas it belongs to, proper assignees are added and milestone is identified. If any of these labels are missing, add one. If labels can not be assigned due to limited privilege or correct label can not be decided, thatâ€™s fine, contact maintainers if needed.Poke issue owner if neededIf an issue owned by a developer has no PR created in 30 days, contact the issue owner and ask for a PR or to release ownership if needed.FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it!
