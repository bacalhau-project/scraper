obtained via a[DISCUSS]thread on thedev@cassandra.apache.orgmailing list.As Cassandra is an ASF project, all included libraries must follow Apache’ssoftware license requirements.Cassandra uses the Ant build system and Maven POMs for dependency
specification.  In Cassandra 5.0 the format of POMs was moved from within thebuild.xmlfile to separate POM template files that are processed by Ant.  In
both pre-5.0 and post-5.0 Cassandra, there are several POMs that dependencies
can be included in:parent-pomContains all dependencies with the respective version. All other poms
will refer to the artifacts with specified versions listed here.Since Cassandra 5.0, theparent-pomtemplate is.build/parent-pom-template.xml.build-deps-pom(-sources)+coverage-deps-pomused by theant buildtarget. Listed dependencies will be resolved and
copied tobuild/lib/{jar,sources}by executing themaven-ant-tasks-retrieve-buildtarget. This should contain libraries that are
required for build tools (grammar, docs, instrumentation), but are not
shipped as part of the Cassandra distribution.Since Cassandra 4.0,coverage-deps-pomhas been removed and thebuild-deps-pomtemplate is.build/cassandra-build-deps-template.xml.all-pomPOM forcassandra-all.jar.
Seerelease process docs.Since Cassandra 5.0, theall-pomtemplate is.build/cassandra-deps-template.xml.test-deps-pomReferenced bymaven-ant-tasks-retrieve-testto retrieve and save
dependencies tobuild/test/lib. Exclusively used during JUnit test
execution.Since Cassandra 3.0,test-deps-pomhas been removed.Theant write-pomstarget produces valid POM files in thebuild/directory.Dependencies added to thelib/directory are built into the release artifacts
by theant artifactstarget (see targetresolver-dist-lib). Libraries
distributed this way must meet theASF distribution policy.Dependency management before Cassandra 5.0To update dependencies, update the parent and child POM definitions inbuild.xml. The parent POM should include thedependencytag withgroupId,artifactId,version, and optionalscopefields. The child POM(s) should
include thedependencytag withgroupIdandartifactId. See theMaven docsfor a complete reference on how to reference dependencies across parent and
child POMs.Here isan exampleof a commit that changes dependency versions pre-5.0.Dependency management in Cassandra 5.0 and laterIn Cassandra 5.0 and later, dependencies are managed in Maven POM templates in.build/*-template.xml. These templates are processed into valid Maven POMs
and copied tobuild/\*.pomby theant write-pomstask.For new dependencies, add toparent-pom-templateandcassandra-deps-template, and optionallycassandra-build-deps-templateif
the dependency is required for build only.  Seethe Maven docson how to reference dependencies in the parent POM from the child POMs.For dependency versions that need to be available inbuild.xmlandparent-pom-template, specify the version as a property inbuild.xml, add it
to theant write-pomstarget, then add the property toparent-pom-templatewith the value of the template substitution.Here isan exampleof a commit that changes dependency versions since 5.0.Troubleshooting and conflict resolutionHere are some useful commands that may help you out resolving conflicts.ant realclean- gets rid of the build directory, including build
artifacts.mvn dependency:tree -f build/apache-cassandra-\*-SNAPSHOT.pom -Dverbose -Dincludes=org.slf4jshows transitive dependency tree for artifacts, e.g. org.slf4j. In
case the command above fails due to a missing parent pom file, try
runningant mvn-install.rm ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/cassandra/apache-cassandra/- removes
