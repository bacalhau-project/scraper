The Apache Software Foundation takes security issues very seriously. Due to the infrastructure nature of the Apache ZooKeeper project specifically, we haven't had many reports over time, but it doesn't mean that we haven't had concerns over some bugs and vulnerabilities. If you have any concern or believe you have uncovered a vulnerability, we suggest that you get in touch via the e-mail address [security@zookeeper.apache.org](mailto:security@zookeeper.apache.org?Subject=[SECURITY] My security issue). In the message, try to provide a description of the issue and ideally a way of reproducing it. Note that this security address should be used only for undisclosed vulnerabilities. Dealing with known issues should be handled regularly via jira and the mailing lists. Please report any security problems to the project security address before disclosing it publicly.
The ASF Security team maintains a page with a description of how vulnerabilities are handled, check their [Web page](https://www.apache.org/security/) for more information.
Severity: critical
Affected versions:
Description:
Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.

Severity: critical
Affected versions:
Description:
Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in Apache ZooKeeper. If SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled in ZooKeeper (quorum.auth.enableSasl=true), the authorization is done by verifying that the instance part in SASL authentication ID is listed in zoo.cfg server list. The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional and if it's missing, like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM', the authorization check will be skipped. As a result an arbitrary endpoint could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader, essentially giving it complete read-write access to the data tree. Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled by default.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1, 3.8.3, 3.7.2, which fixes the issue.
Alternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.
See the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.

Severity: Critical
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: ZooKeeper prior to 3.4.14 ZooKeeper 3.5.0-alpha through 3.5.4-beta. The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affected.
Description: ZooKeeper’s getACL() command doesn’t check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.
Mitigation: Use an authentication method other than Digest (e.g. Kerberos) or upgrade to 3.4.14 or later (3.5.5 or later if on the 3.5 branch).

Severity: Critical
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: ZooKeeper prior to 3.4.10 ZooKeeper 3.5.0-alpha through 3.5.3-beta The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affected
Description: No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server attempts to join a quorum. As a result an arbitrary end point could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader.
Mitigation: Upgrade to 3.4.10 or later (3.5.4-beta or later if on the 3.5 branch) and enable Quorum Peer mutual authentication.
Alternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.

Severity: moderate
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: ZooKeeper 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 ZooKeeper 3.5.0 to 3.5.2 The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affected
Note: The 3.5 branch is still beta at this time.
Description: Two four letter word commands “wchp/wchc” are CPU intensive and could cause spike of CPU utilization on ZooKeeper server if abused, which leads to the server unable to serve legitimate client requests. There is no known compromise which takes advantage of this vulnerability.
Mitigation: This affects ZooKeeper ensembles whose client port is publicly accessible, so it is recommended to protect ZooKeeper ensemble with firewall. Documentation has also been updated to clarify on this point. In addition, a patch (ZOOKEEPER-2693) is provided to disable "wchp/wchc” commands by default. - ZooKeeper 3.4.x users should upgrade to 3.4.10 or apply the patch. - ZooKeeper 3.5.x users should upgrade to 3.5.3 or apply the patch.

Severity: moderate
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: ZooKeeper 3.4.0 to 3.4.8 ZooKeeper 3.5.0 to 3.5.2 The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affected
Note: The 3.5 branch is still alpha at this time.
Description: The ZooKeeper C client shells "cli_st" and "cli_mt" have a buffer overflow vulnerability associated with parsing of the input command when using the "cmd:
Mitigation: It is important to use the fully featured/supported Java cli shell rather than the C cli shell independent of version.
ZooKeeper 3.4.x users should upgrade to 3.4.9 or apply this [patch](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=zookeeper.git;a=commitdiff;h=27ecf981a15554dc8e64a28630af7a5c9e2bdf4f)
ZooKeeper 3.5.x users should upgrade to 3.5.3 when released or apply this [patch](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=zookeeper.git;a=commitdiff;h=f09154d6648eeb4ec5e1ac8a2bacbd2f8c87c14a)
The patch solves the problem reported here, but it does not make the client ready for production use. The community has no plan to make this client production ready at this time, and strongly recommends that users move to the Java cli and use the C cli for illustration purposes only.
