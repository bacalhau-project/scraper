Due to the infrastructure nature of the Apache ZooKeeper project specifically, we haven't had many reports over time, but it doesn't mean that we haven't had concerns over some bugs and vulnerabilities. If you have any concern or believe you have uncovered a vulnerability, we suggest that you get in touch via the e-mail addresssecurity@zookeeper.apache.org. In the message, try to provide a description of the issue and ideally a way of reproducing it. Note that this security address should be used only for undisclosed vulnerabilities. Dealing with known issues should be handled regularly via jira and the mailing lists.Please report any security problems to the project security address before disclosing it publicly.The ASF Security team maintains a page with a description of how vulnerabilities are handled, check theirWeb pagefor more information.Vulnerability reportsCVE-2024-23944: Information disclosure in persistent watcher handlingCVE-2023-44981: Authorization bypass in SASL Quorum Peer AuthenticationCVE-2019-0201: Information disclosure vulnerability in Apache ZooKeeperCVE-2018-8012: Apache ZooKeeper Quorum Peer mutual authenticationCVE-2017-5637: DOS attack on wchp/wchc four letter words (4lw)CVE-2016-5017: Buffer overflow vulnerability in ZooKeeper C cli shellCVE-2024-23944: Information disclosure in persistent watcher handlingSeverity: criticalAffected versions:Apache ZooKeeper 3.9.0 through 3.9.1Apache ZooKeeper 3.8.0 through 3.8.3Apache ZooKeeper 3.6.0 through 3.7.2Description:Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.Credit:å¨åå®(å¯æ³)zhoujian.zja@alibaba-inc.com(reporter)References:https://zookeeper.apache.org/https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23944CVE-2023-44981: Authorization bypass in SASL Quorum Peer AuthenticationSeverity: criticalAffected versions:Apache ZooKeeper 3.9.0Apache ZooKeeper 3.8.0 through 3.8.2Apache ZooKeeper 3.7.0 through 3.7.1Apache ZooKeeper before 3.7.0Description:Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in Apache ZooKeeper. If SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled in ZooKeeper (quorum.auth.enableSasl=true), the authorization is done by verifying that the instance part in SASL authentication ID is listed in zoo.cfg server list. The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional and if it's missing, like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM', the authorization check will be skipped. As a result an arbitrary endpoint could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader, essentially giving it complete read-write access to the data tree. Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled by default.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1, 3.8.3, 3.7.2, which fixes the issue.Alternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.See the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.Credit:Damien Diederenddiederen@apache.org(reporter)References:https://zookeeper.apache.org/https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44981CVE-2019-0201: Information disclosure vulnerability in Apache ZooKeeperSeverity: CriticalVendor: The Apache Software FoundationVersions Affected: ZooKeeper prior to 3.4.14 ZooKeeper 3.5.0-alpha through 3.5.4-beta. The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affected.Description: ZooKeeperâs getACL() command doesnât check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.Mitigation: Use an authentication method other than Digest (e.g. Kerberos) or upgrade to 3.4.14 or later (3.5.5 or later if on the 3.5 branch).Credit: This issue was identified by Harrison Nealharrison@patchadvisor.comPatchAdvisor, Inc.References: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1392CVE-2018-8012: Apache ZooKeeper Quorum Peer mutual authenticationSeverity: CriticalVendor: The Apache Software FoundationVersions Affected: ZooKeeper prior to 3.4.10 ZooKeeper 3.5.0-alpha through 3.5.3-beta The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affectedDescription: No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server attempts to join a quorum. As a result an arbitrary end point could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader.Mitigation: Upgrade to 3.4.10 or later (3.5.4-beta or later if on the 3.5 branch) and enable Quorum Peer mutual authentication.Alternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.See the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.Credit: This issue was identified by FÃ¶ldi TamÃ¡s and Eugene KoontzReferences: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1045 https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Server-Server+mutual+authentication https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.htmlCVE-2017-5637: DOS attack on wchp/wchc four letter words (4lw) {#CVE-2017-5637}Severity: moderateVendor: The Apache Software FoundationVersions Affected: ZooKeeper 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 ZooKeeper 3.5.0 to 3.5.2 The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affectedNote: The 3.5 branch is still beta at this time.Description: Two four letter word commands âwchp/wchcâ are CPU intensive and could cause spike of CPU utilization on ZooKeeper server if abused, which leads to the server unable to serve legitimate client requests. There is no known compromise which takes advantage of this vulnerability.Mitigation: This affects ZooKeeper ensembles whose client port is publicly accessible, so it is recommended to protect ZooKeeper ensemble with firewall. Documentation has also been updated to clarify on this point. In addition, a patch (ZOOKEEPER-2693) is provided to disable "wchp/wchcâ commands by default. - ZooKeeper 3.4.x users should upgrade to 3.4.10 or apply the patch. - ZooKeeper 3.5.x users should upgrade to 3.5.3 or apply the patch.References [1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2693CVE-2016-5017: Buffer overflow vulnerability in ZooKeeper C cli shell {#CVE-2016-5017}Severity: moderateVendor: The Apache Software FoundationVersions Affected: ZooKeeper 3.4.0 to 3.4.8 ZooKeeper 3.5.0 to 3.5.2 The unsupported ZooKeeper 1.x through 3.3.x versions may be also affectedNote: The 3.5 branch is still alpha at this time.Description: The ZooKeeper C client shells "cli_st" and "cli_mt" have a buffer overflow vulnerability associated with parsing of the input command when using the "cmd:" batch mode syntax. If the command string exceeds 1024 characters a buffer overflow will occur. There is no known compromise which takes advantage of this vulnerability, and if security is enabled the attacker would be limited by client level security constraints. The C cli shell is intended as a sample/example of how to use the C client interface, not as a production tool - the documentation has also been clarified on this point.Mitigation: It is important to use the fully featured/supported Java cli shell rather than the C cli shell independent of version.ZooKeeper 3.4.x users should upgrade to 3.4.9 or apply thispatchZooKeeper 3.5.x users should upgrade to 3.5.3 when released or apply thispatchThe patch solves the problem reported here, but it does not make the client ready for production use. The community has no plan to make this client production ready at this time, and strongly recommends that users move to the Java cli and use the C cli for illustration purposes only.Credit: This issue was discovered by Lyon Yang (@l0Op3r)References:Apache ZooKeeper Security PageCopyright © 2010-2020The Apache Software Foundation, Licensed under theApache License, Version 2.0.Apache ZooKeeper, ZooKeeper, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache ZooKeeper project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.
