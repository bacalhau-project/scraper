bucket under a specific key.Key-Value stores are used extensively in modern cloud-native infrastructure,
indeed etcd is the main storage engine of Kubernetes.In recent releases we have made several enhancements to JetStream with regard to wildcard

JetStream to be a powerful Key-Value store.Today we’ll show an experimental feature added to thenatsCLI with full client
APIs to follow for our major supported languages.Some features we will support:Multiple named Buckets, each with replication, historical values and cluster affinityBasic key-value operations of Get, Put and WatchPer key TTLs for auto expiring of keysEncoders and Decoders allowing zero trust data storageIn-memory read cachesGlobal replication for read-replicas stored near your clientsRead-After-Write safetyPlease enjoy the accompanying video to see this experimental feature in action and get
