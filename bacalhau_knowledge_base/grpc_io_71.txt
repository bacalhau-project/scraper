transport encryption system developed by Google. It is used for securing RPC
communications within Google’s infrastructure. ALTS is similar to mutual TLS
but has been designed and optimized to meet the needs of Google’s production
environments. For more information, take a look at theALTS whitepaper.ALTS in gRPC has the following features:Create gRPC servers & clients with ALTS as the transport security protocol.ALTS connections are end-to-end protected with privacy and integrity.Applications can access peer information such as the peer service account.Client authorization and server authorization support.Minimal code changes to enable ALTS.gRPC users can configure their applications to use ALTS as a transport security
protocol with few lines of code.Note that ALTS is fully functional if the application runs onCompute EngineorGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE).gRPC Client with ALTS Transport Security ProtocolgRPC clients can use ALTS credentials to connect to servers, as illustrated in
