Wally Quevedo, a core member of the NATS team, gave a must-watch talk onmonitoring gnatsd servers.We are kicking off first#NATSioLondon Meetup ðŸ™‹pic.twitter.com/NjulXL2Ut1â€” Hack gone Ops (@milosgajdos)October 20, 2015TheNATS community in Londonhas been very active in using NATS, as well as helping us validate our roadmap concepts and direction. TheLondon Microservices User Grouphas been great about sharing information on NATS at their meetups, and weâ€™ve enjoyed getting to know some of that group better as well.So the next place that made sense to host a meetup was London.On October 20th, we held the first international NATS meetup in London at theMakerâ€™s Academy, a web dev bootcamp in the heart of Silicon Roundabout. The team at Makerâ€™s Academy were very helpful arranging the meeting space, and it was perfect for the group. It didnâ€™t hurt that we had extra pizza to go around either, and we were able to give away an Amazon Gift Card to the winner of the drawing,Milos Gajdos!Time for Bill Chute from Accadian Limited!pic.twitter.com/8VaOv7zjVUâ€” repejota (@repejota)October 20, 2015The guest speakers were excellent.Bill ChuteofAcadiant Limitedgave a talk about how they use NATS at Acadiant, and also dived in with some code snippets and examples.Raul PerezofCarrenzathen gave a great overview of how they use NATS in their IaaS/PaaS platform (Ernest), and the value of NATS in relation to some key Microservices concepts.
