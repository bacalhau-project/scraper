Documentation
Java task driver
Use the Nomad Java task driver to run Java applications in your Nomad cluster without the need to containerize them.
Use case
Modernize non-containerized applications without the need to refactor or rewrite.
Challenge
Once an organization has started to develop new container-native applications, it isn't uncommon to start thinking about how you can bring those benefits to existing applications. Most companies are taking an incremental migration approach that often requires multi-year efforts to fully refactor or rewrite the legacy applications.
Solution
Nomad's flexible workload support enables an organization to run containerized, non-containerized, and batch applications, allowing companies to migrate at their own pace and maintain one single workflow during the whole journey. Nomad natively supports running legacy applications, static binaries, Java JARs, QEMU virtual machines, and simple OS commands directly while bringing bin packing, automation, multi-upgrade strategies, and many other modern orchestration benefits without the cost of rewriting or refactoring.
