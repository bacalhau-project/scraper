Release archive checksum verification
If you would like to verify the checksum of a HashiCorp product download (specifically, an archive from [https://releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com)), please note that only the SHA256SUM file is signed by the PGP key above. The archives themselves are not signed, but rather hashed. To verify the integrity of a particular archive:
Download the archive, SHA256SUM, and SHA256SUM.sig files (multiple .sig files may be present, named with the associated signing PGP key ID)
Verify the SHA256SUM file is properly signed
Verify the SHA256SUM in the file matches the archive
For example:
# Import the public key as referenced above.
curl -s https://www.hashicorp.com/.well-known/pgp-key.txt | gpg --import
# Download the archive and signature files.
curl -Os https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.15.2/vault_1.15.2_linux_amd64.zip
curl -Os https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.15.2/vault_1.15.2_SHA256SUMS
curl -Os https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.15.2/vault_1.15.2_SHA256SUMS.sig
# Verify the signature file is untampered.
gpg --verify vault_1.15.2_SHA256SUMS.sig vault_1.15.2_SHA256SUMS
# Verify the SHASUM matches the archive.
shasum -a 256 -c vault_1.15.2_SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing

Product binary signature verification
HashiCorp [Authenticode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/authenticode) signs Microsoft Windows executables and [code signs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) Apple macOS executables.
Apple macOS
Use Apple's codesign
utility to verify the integrity of an Apple macOS executable and pay attention to the TeamIdentifier
field which should match the one below.
codesign --verify -d --verbose=2 /usr/local/bin/terraform
Executable=/usr/local/bin/terraform
Identifier=terraform
...
Authority=Developer ID Application: Hashicorp, Inc. (D38WU7D763)
Authority=Developer ID Certification Authority
Authority=Apple Root CA

Microsoft Windows
Windows binaries may be signed by certificates with thumbprints matching 7868E4F55FD7B047CD8BF93FEA8C38509CFB5939
, 6F1DCD6FE62C173708E26E25D19656E413277816
, or 35AB9FC834D217E9E7B1778FB1B97AF7C73792F2.
