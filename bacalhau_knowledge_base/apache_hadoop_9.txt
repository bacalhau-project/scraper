The security mailing list is a private list for discussion of potential security vulnerabilities issues. Please post potential security vulnerabilities to this list so that they may be investigated and fixed before the vulnerabilities is published.

For information on published vulnerabilities please see our [CVE list](cve_list.html).
This mailing list is only for discussing security vulnerabilities in hadoop ‘source’ code, NOT security advisories for thirdparty libraries. For security issues related to thirdparty libraries use the dev/user mailing lists. However, when after analysis it turns out the advisory impacts Hadoop, that should be discussed on the security list.
The thirdparty library versions in the upcoming releases can be checked here:
Note: Not all vulnerabilities coming from thirdparty libraries impact hadoop and it isn’t possible to update every thirdparty library. Read a hadoop developer’s point of view on upgrading thirdparty libraries [here](https://s.apache.org/transitive-issues)
