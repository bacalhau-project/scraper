other secrets. To enable secure, auditable and easy access to your secrets,
Nomad integrates with HashiCorp'sVault. Nomad servers and clients
coordinate with Vault to derive a Vault token that has access to only the Vault
policies the tasks needs. Nomad clients make the token available to the task and
handle the tokens renewal.ConfigurationIn order to use Vault with Nomad, you will need to configure and install Vault
separately from Nomad. Nomad does not run Vault for you.Agent ConfigurationTo enable Vault integration, Nomad agents must be configured withvaultblocks. Each block can be enabled or disabled and configures how
Nomad connects to the Vault cluster.Dynamic Configuration with SecretsNomad's job specification includes atemplateblock that uses a tool
calledConsul Template. When used with Vault, this mechanism creates a
convenient way to ship configuration files that are populated from Vault
secrets.For more information on Nomad's template block please see thetemplatejob specification documentation.Vault ACLThe Vault ACL system protects the cluster from unauthorized access. When
enabled, both Vault and Nomad must be properly configured in order for their
integrations to work.Refer to theVault ACL integration pagefor more information.Multiple Vault ClustersEnterpriseEnterpriseNomad Enterprise supports access to multiple Vault clusters. They can be
configured using multiplevaultblocks with differentnamevalues. If anameis not provided, the cluster configuration is calleddefault.Jobs that need access to Vault may specify which Vault cluster to use with thevault.clusterparameter.CompatibilityNomad versions 1.4.0 and above are compatible with any currently supported
