(Homebrew)LinuxHomebrew on LinuxInstallation as part of Kubernetes installationInstallation on Kubernetes, using a statefulset or helm chartInstallation checkVersionsv3.6-DRAFTInstallInstallInstructions for installing etcd from pre-built binaries or from source.RequirementsBefore installing etcd, see the following pages:Supported platformsHardware recommendationsInstall pre-built binariesThe easiest way to install etcd is from pre-built binaries:Download the compressed archive file for your platform fromReleases,
choosing releasev3.6.0-alpha.0or later.Unpack the archive file. This results in a directory containing the binaries.Add the executable binaries to your path. For example, rename and/or move
the binaries to a directory in your path (like/usr/local/bin), or add the
directory created by the previous step to your path.From a shell, test thatetcdis in your path:$ etcd --versionetcd Version: 3.6.0-alpha.0...Build from sourceIf you haveGo version 1.21+, you can build etcd from
source by following these steps:Download the etcd repo as a zip fileand unzip it, or clone the
repo using the following command.$ git clone -b v3.6.0-alpha.0 https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd.gitTo build frommain@HEAD, omit the-b v3.6.0-alpha.0flag.Change directory:$cdetcdRun the build script:$ ./scripts/build.shThe binaries are under thebindirectory.Add the full path to thebindirectory to your path, for example:$exportPATH="$PATH:`pwd`/bin"Test thatetcdis in your path:$ etcd --versionInstallation via OS packagesDisclaimer: etcd installations through OS package managers can deliver outdated versions since they are not being automatically maintained nor officially supported by etcd project. Therefore use OS packages with caution.There are various ways of installing etcd on different operating systems and these are just some examples how it can be done.MacOS (Homebrew)Update homebrew:$ brew updateInstall etcd:$ brew install etcdVerify install$ etcd --versionLinuxAlthough installing etcd through many major Linux distributions’ official repositories and package managers is possible, the published versions can be significantly outdated. So, installing this way is strongly discouraged.The recommended way to install etcd on Linux is either throughpre-built binariesor by using Homebrew.Homebrew on LinuxHomebrew can run on Linux, and can provide recent software versions.PrerequisitesUpdate Homebrew:$ brew updateProcedureInstall usingbrew:$ brew install etcdResultVerify installation by getting the version:$ etcd --versionetcd Version: 3.6.0-alpha.0...Installation as part of Kubernetes installationRunning etcd as a Kubernetes StatefulSetInstallation on Kubernetes, using a statefulset or helm chartThe etcd project does not currently maintain a helm chart, however you can follow the instructions provided byBitnami’s etcd Helm chart.Installation checkFor a slightly more involved sanity check of your installation, seeQuickstart.FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it!
