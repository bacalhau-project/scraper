These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.
If you have a SequenceFile with an old key or value class which has been renamed, you can use WritableName.addName to add an alias class. This functionality previously existed, but only worked for classes which extend Writable. It now works for any class, notably key or value classes which use io.serializations.
