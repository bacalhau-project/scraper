The first non-trivial zeros can be seen at Im(s) = ±14.135, ±21.022 and ±25.011. TheRiemann hypothesis, a famous conjecture, says that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie along the critical line.Inmathematics, aconjectureis aconclusionor apropositionthat is proffered on a tentative basis withoutproof.[1][2][3]Some conjectures, such as theRiemann hypothesisorFermat's conjecture(now atheorem, proven in 1995 byAndrew Wiles), have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.[4]Resolution of conjectures[edit]Proof[edit]Formal mathematics is based onprovabletruth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting auniversally quantifiedconjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a singlecounterexamplecould immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done. For instance, theCollatz conjecture, which concerns whether or not certainsequencesofintegersterminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 × 1012(over a trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that the conjecture is true—because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.Nevertheless, mathematicians often regard a conjecture as strongly supported by evidence even though not yet proved. That evidence may be of various kinds, such as verification of consequences of it or strong interconnections with known results.[5]A conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; seemethods of mathematical prooffor more details.One method of proof, applicable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as "brute force": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. In some occasions, the number of cases is quite large, in which case a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases. For example, the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of thefour color theoremby computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 bytheorem-provingsoftware.When a conjecture has beenproven, it is no longer a conjecture but atheorem. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as theGeometrization theorem(which resolved thePoincaré conjecture),Fermat's Last Theorem, and others.Disproof[edit]Conjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to asfalse conjectures(cf. thePólya conjectureandEuler's sum of powers conjecture). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although it has been subsequently found that the minimal counterexample is actually smaller.Independent conjectures[edit]Not every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. Thecontinuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relativecardinalityof certaininfinite sets, was eventually shown to beindependentfrom the generally accepted set ofZermelo–Fraenkel axiomsof set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a newaxiomin a consistent manner (much asEuclid'sparallel postulatecan be taken either as true or false in an axiomatic system for geometry).In this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof thatdoes notrequire the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements inEuclidean geometrybe proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. without the parallel postulate). The one major exception to this in practice is theaxiom of choice, as the majority of researchers usually do not worry whether a result requires it—unless they are studying this axiom in particular.Conditional proofs[edit]Sometimes, a conjecture is called ahypothesiswhen it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, theRiemann hypothesisis a conjecture fromnumber theorythat — amongst other things — makes predictions about the distribution ofprime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In fact, in anticipation of its eventual proof, some have even proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are calledconditional proofs: the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.These "proofs", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.Important examples[edit]Fermat's Last Theorem[edit]Main article:Fermat's Last TheoremInnumber theory,Fermat's Last Theorem(sometimes calledFermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no threepositiveintegersa{\displaystyle a},b{\displaystyle b}, andc{\displaystyle c}can satisfy the equationan+bn=cn{\displaystyle a^{n}+b^{n}=c^{n}}for any integer value ofn{\displaystyle n}greater than two.This theorem was first conjectured byPierre de Fermatin 1637 in the margin of a copy ofArithmetica, where he claimed that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin.[6]The first successful proofwas released in 1994 byAndrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The unsolved problem stimulated the development ofalgebraic number theoryin the 19th century, and the proof of themodularity theoremin the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in thehistory of mathematics, and prior to its proof it was in theGuinness Book of World Recordsfor "most difficult mathematical problems".[7]Four color theorem[edit]Main article:Four color theoremA four-coloring of a map of the states of the United States (ignoring lakes).Inmathematics, thefour color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that given any separation of a plane intocontiguousregions, producing a figure called amap, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map—so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are calledadjacentif they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.[8]For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share apointthat also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.Möbiusmentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840.[9]The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852[10]whenFrancis Guthrie, while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. Thefive color theorem, which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century;[11]however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and falsecounterexampleshave appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.The four color theorem was ultimately proven in 1976 byKenneth AppelandWolfgang Haken. It was the first majortheoremto beproved using a computer. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem (i.e., if they did appear, one could make a smaller counter-example). Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this with hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexample exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by mathematicians at all because thecomputer-assisted proofwas infeasible for a human to check by hand.[12]However, the proof has since then gained wider acceptance, although doubts still remain.[13]Hauptvermutung[edit]Main article:HauptvermutungTheHauptvermutung(German for main conjecture) ofgeometric topologyis the conjecture that any twotriangulationsof atriangulable spacehave a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, bySteinitzandTietze.[14]This conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved byJohn Milnor[15]in 1961 usingReidemeister torsion.Themanifoldversion is true indimensionsm≤ 3. The casesm= 2 and 3were proved byTibor RadóandEdwin E. Moise[16]in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.Weil conjectures[edit]Main article:Weil conjecturesInmathematics, theWeil conjectureswere some highly influential proposals byAndré Weil(1949) on thegenerating functions(known aslocal zeta-functions) derived from counting the number of points onalgebraic varietiesoverfinite fields.A varietyVover a finite field withqelements has a finite number ofrational points, as well as points over every finite field withqkelements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbersNkof points over the (essentially unique) field withqkelements.Weil conjectured that suchzeta-functionsshould berational functions, should satisfy a form offunctional equation, and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on theRiemann zeta functionandRiemann hypothesis. The rationality was proved byDwork (1960), the functional equation byGrothendieck (1965), and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was  proved byDeligne (1974).Poincaré conjecture[edit]Main article:Poincaré conjectureInmathematics, thePoincaré conjectureis atheoremabout thecharacterizationof the3-sphere, which is the hypersphere that bounds theunit ballin four-dimensional space. The conjecture states that:Everysimply connected,closed3-manifoldishomeomorphicto the 3-sphere.An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism calledhomotopy equivalence: if a 3-manifold ishomotopy equivalentto the 3-sphere, then it is necessarilyhomeomorphicto it.Originally conjectured byHenri Poincaréin 1904, the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (aclosed3-manifold). The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that eachloopin the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere. Ananalogous resulthas been known in higher dimensions for some time.After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians,Grigori Perelmanpresented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 onarXiv. The proof followed on from the program ofRichard S. Hamiltonto use theRicci flowto attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, calledRicci flow with surgeryto systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method "converged" in three dimensions.[17]Perelman completed this portion of the proof. Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.The Poincaré conjecture, before being proven, was one of the most important open questions intopology.Riemann hypothesis[edit]Main article:Riemann hypothesisIn mathematics, theRiemann hypothesis, proposed byBernhard Riemann(1859), is a conjecture that the non-trivialzerosof theRiemann zeta functionall havereal part1/2.  The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as theRiemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.The Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution ofprime numbers. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem inpure mathematics.[18]The Riemann hypothesis, along with theGoldbach conjecture, is part ofHilbert's eighth probleminDavid Hilbert's list of23 unsolved problems; it is also one of theClay Mathematics InstituteMillennium Prize Problems.P versus NP problem[edit]Main article:P versus NP problemTheP versus NP problemis a majorunsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no. It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written byKurt GödeltoJohn von Neumann.  Gödel asked whether a certain NP-complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.[19]The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 byStephen Cookin his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures"[20]and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field.[21]It is one of the sevenMillennium Prize Problemsselected by theClay Mathematics Instituteto carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.Other conjectures[edit]Goldbach's conjectureThetwin prime conjectureTheCollatz conjectureTheManin conjectureTheMaldacena conjectureTheEuler conjecture, proposed by Euler in the 18th century but for which counterexamples for a number of exponents (starting with n=4) were found beginning in the mid 20th centuryTheHardy-Littlewood conjecturesare a pair of conjectures concerning the distribution of prime numbers, the first of which expands upon the aforementioned twin prime conjecture. Neither one has either been proven or disproven, but ithasbeen proven that both cannot simultaneously be true (i.e., at least one must be false). It has not been proven which one is false, but it is widely believed that the first conjecture is true and the second one is false.[22]TheLanglands program[23]is a far-reaching web of these ideas of 'unifying conjectures' that link different subfields of mathematics (e.g. betweennumber theoryandrepresentation theoryofLie groups). Some of these conjectures have since been proved.In other sciences[edit]Karl Popperpioneered the use of the term "conjecture" inscientific philosophy.[24]Conjecture is related tohypothesis, which insciencerefers to a testable conjecture.See also[edit]Bold hypothesisFutures studiesHypotheticalsList of conjecturesRamanujan machineReferences[edit]^"Definition of CONJECTURE".www.merriam-webster.com.
