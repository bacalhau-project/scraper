HDFS Router-Router Based Federation now supports storing delegation tokens on MySQL,
[HADOOP-18535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18535)
which improves token operation through over the original Zookeeper-based implementation.
[HADOOP-18671](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18671) moved a number of
HDFS-specific APIs to Hadoop Common to make it possible for certain applications that
depend on HDFS semantics to run on other Hadoop compatible file systems.
In particular, recoverLease() and isFileClosed() are exposed through LeaseRecoverable interface, while setSafeMode() is exposed through SafeMode interface.
