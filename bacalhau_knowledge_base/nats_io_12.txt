Overcoming these obstacles requires the application of efficient edge computing techniques, robust security measures, standardized protocols, scalable management systems, and advanced data processing capabilities.By combining the strengths of NATS JetStream, RisingWave, and Superset, a powerful solution emerges for the development of reliable and scalable real-time IoT applications. This solution leverages NATS JetStream’s efficient messaging capabilities, RisingWave’s secure and adaptable infrastructure, and Superset’s advanced data visualization and analytics features. Together, these tools create a cohesive ecosystem that empowers developers to confidently and efficiently address the complexities of real-time IoT data processing.What is RisingWave?RisingWaveRisingWave is a distributed SQL streaming database that enables simple, efficient, and reliable processing of streaming data. It’s easy to set up, use, and operate.What is NATS JetStream?NATS is a secure connectivity technology designed for discovering and exchanging messages in distributed systems. It can be deployed in any environment for different use cases such as microservices, data streaming, and IoT, supporting edge devices with a large number of languages and clients for interaction. JetStream is a built-in distributed persistence engine for NATS. It enables new functionalities and higher qualities of service on top of the base ‘Core NATS’ functionalities and qualities of service.What is Superset?Apache Superset is a modern data exploration and data visualization platform. It is an open-source software that can replace or augment proprietary business intelligence tools for many teams.OverviewIn this blog, we will delve into an IoT scenario where we focus on monitoring temperature and humidity data from IoT sensors. We will explore how NATS JetStream empowers edge devices to effortlessly transmit data streams to RisingWave for real-time processing. By employing window operations and aggregations, RisingWave efficiently performs advanced analytics on the data. Finally, we showcase the visualization of the processed and analyzed data using tables, charts, and an integrated dashboard powered by Superset.1. Set up NATS JetStreamThe NATS Server is highly optimized, featuring a compact binary of less than 20 MB. This enables it to run effortlessly on a spectrum of machines, ranging from a Raspberry Pi to the largest of servers, whether in the cloud, on-premise, at the edge, on bare metal, on VMs, or in containers.You can install NATS JetStream using Docker, as follows:docker pull nats:latestTo run NATS JetStream on Docker, you can start the NATS server with the-jsflag. This flag enables the JetStream feature and allows you to leverage its capabilities.docker run -p 4222:4222 -ti nats:latest -jsIt starts NATS JetStream. Now you can publish and subscribe to messages via a variety of languages and clients.NATS JetStream server running at port 4222.2. Publish data to JetStreamIn this example, we publish IoT data to JetStream’s stream namedevent_streamusing theiot_datasubject. Here is a sample of the data being published:'{"device_Id":"sensor1","temperature":25,"ts":"2023-01-05 05:50:00+00:00"},'{"device_Id":"sensor1","temperature":26,"ts":"2023-01-05 05:50:01+00:00"}''{"device_Id":"sensor2","humidity":60,"ts":"2023-01-05 05:50:01+00:00"}''{"device_Id":"sensor1","temperature":27,"ts":"2023-01-05 05:50:02+00:00"}''{"device_Id":"sensor2","humidity":62,"ts":"2023-01-05 05:50:02+00:00"}'3. Ingest data from JetStream into RisingWaveWe can use the open-source RisingWave or the managed service, RisingWave Cloud, for ingesting and processing streaming data. In this blog, we’ll use RisingWave Cloud, which offers a user-friendly experience and simplifies the operational aspects of managing and utilizing RisingWave for our IoT monitoring solution.Create a RisingWave clusterCreate a RisingWave cluster inRisingWave Cloudusing the developer tier. See thedocumentation of RisingWave Cloudfor instructions.Create a table in RisingWave to ingest data streamsNow create a table in RisingWave to ingest data from the stream namedevent_streamin theiot_datasubject that was set up earlier.

Visualize the data in Apache SupersetWe’ll configure Superset to read data from RisingWave and build visualizations.Connect RisingWave to SupersetYou can use RisingWave as a data source in Apache Superset for creating visualizations and dashboards using the tables and materialized views in RisingWave. To understand the process, follow the instructions inConfigure Superset to read data from RisingWave.After successfully connecting RisingWave to Apache Superset, we add the materialized views in RisingWave as datasets to create tables, various charts, and a unified dashboard.Visualize data with Apache Superset: table, charts, and dashboardThe table below presents temperature information such as the temperature sensor ID, temperature readings, and corresponding timestamps for each reading.The table below presents humidity information such as the humidity sensor ID, humidity readings, and timestamps associated with each reading.This bar chart is generated from theavg_temperature_mvdataset, showcasing the average temperature derived from temperature sensors within predefined 1-minute time windows.This line chart is generated from theavg_humidity_mvdataset, illustrating the average humidity derived from humidity sensors within specified 1-minute time windows.This unified dashboard offers a collection of charts that facilitate comprehensive real-time monitoring of IoT devices. By providing valuable insights into the readings of temperature and humidity sensors at each corresponding timestamp, it empowers users to make informed decisions and effectively monitor industrial IoT devices.ConclusionIn this blog, we present a step-by-step guide on constructing a real-time IoT monitoring solution by leveraging NATS JetStream, RisingWave, and Superset. With their seamless integration, a real-time IoT dashboard can be created in under an hour.About the authorFahad Shah is a developer advocate atRisingWave Labs.Additional resourcesTo stay up to date on the latest developments or view the code, visit theRisingWave GitHub repository- To learn about what’s new about RisingWave, follow RisingWave onTwitter.To ask questions about RisingWave, join theRisingWave Slack workspace.To have an in-depth understanding of RisingWave, check out thedocumentation.Back to BlogCopyright © NATS Authors 2024NATS is aCloud Native Computing Foundationincubating projectThe Linux Foundation has registered trademarks and uses trademarks.For a list of trademarks of The Linux Foundation, please seeTrademark Usage page.
