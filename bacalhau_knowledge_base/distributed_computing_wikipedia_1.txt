Please tell other users about these changes. Not all changes will affect you.Translationsare available.Feature newsAdministrators can now test thetemporary accountsfeature on test2wiki. This was done to allow cross-wiki testing of temporary accounts, for when temporary accounts switch between projects. The feature was enabled on testwiki a few weeks ago. No further temporary account deployments are scheduled yet. Temporary Accounts is a project to create a new type of user account that replaces IP addresses of unregistered editors which are no longer made public. Pleaseshare your opinions and questions on the project talk page.Later this week, editors at wikis that useFlaggedRevs(also known as "Pending Changes") may notice that the indicators at the top of articles have changed. This change makes the system more consistent with the rest of the MediaWiki interface.[1]Bugs statusEditors who use the 2010 wikitext editor, and use the Character Insert buttons, willno longerexperience problems with the buttons adding content into the edit-summary instead of the edit-window. You can read more about that, and 26 other community-submitted tasks that wereresolved last week.Project updatesPlease review and vote onFocus Areas, which are groups of wishes that share a problem. Focus Areas were created for the newly reopened Community Wishlist, which is now open year-round for submissions. The first batch of focus areas are specific to moderator workflows, around welcoming newcomers, minimizing repetitive tasks, and prioritizing tasks. Once volunteers have reviewed and voted on focus areas, the Foundation will then review and select focus areas for prioritization.Do you have a project and are willing to provide a three (3) month mentorship for an intern?Outreachyis a twice a year program for people to participate in a paid internship that will start in December 2024 and end in early March 2025, and they need mentors and projects to work on.
