[NATS .NET Client v2 Alpha Released with Core NATS Support](/blog/nats-dotnet-v2-alpha-release/)
ZIYA SUZEN — July 13, 2023
Starting in 2018 with .NET Core 2.1 , the .NET platform began to receive serious performance improvements in every major release. This excited many .NET developers, who have been enjoying faster and more efficient runtimes just by upgrading their project targets with every new .NET release. In 2021, .NET 6 became the first LTS release under Microsoft’s new .NET and .NET Core Support Policy .
The original NATS .NET client, called NATS.
[Release Candidate - NATS 1.0.0 Helm Chart](/blog/nats-helm-chart-1.0.0-rc/)
CALEB LLOYD — July 5, 2023
As the Kubernetes ecosystem continues to grow, installing NATS via Helm has become a very popular method.
The NATS 0.x series of the Helm Chart was initially released in 2020, a full year before JetStream was even available in the NATS Server.
The past 3 years have taught us that it is important to support all of the extensibility options possible in Kubernetes resources - custom Image Registries, ConfigMaps, TLS Secrets, Volumes and Mounts, Init Containers, and more.

DAVID GEE — June 26, 2023
We’re lucky to have partners and customers in healthcare and even luckier to have a team of highly skilled and talented software engineers. So when the challenge came along to build a meaningful demo for a Telehealth scenario, we couldn’t resist. No conversation on this topic would be complete without a sprinkle of AI or ML and so we posit that when used for good, these technologies can be applied to the preservation and quality of human life.

Data Synchronization Between Microservices With microservice architectures becoming the standard nowadays, it is a common need to extract data from your database to synchronize other downstream services.
Consider a social network where you have a service that stores new posts in a MongoDB collection. You may want to notify other services when a post is created, perhaps so that you can save it on Redis for fast retrieval, or add it to Elastic for full text search queries.

BYRON RUTH — May 9, 2023
k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution suitable for IoT and edge computing environments. One component k3s leverages is KINE , which is a shim enabling the replacement of etcd with alternate storage backends originally targeting relational databases.
In April 2022, the v0.9.0 release of KINE introduced native support for NATS as a backend. In June 2022, the k3s v1.23.7+k3s1 release included this KINE version making it possible for k3s deployments to connect to an existing NATS system.

The NATS maintainers are very proud to announce the 2.9.16 release ! 🥳
This release brings another round of stability and performance improvements, leveraging our new quality engineering practices described in the 2.9.15 announcement post , and iterating directly with users having high-scale and latency-sensitive workloads.
Given the positive feedback on the previous announcement post focusing on the higher-level impact of the changes, going forward all releases will have an announcement post!

Normally, the NATS maintainers do not publish a dedicated announcement for a patch release, but the 2.9.15 release of the NATS server has several significant stability and performance improvements worth highlighting, all driven by our new quality engineering process! 🥳
What does a patch release mean to NATS? And what are these new quality engineering processes?
Release management At the beginning of 2023, the NATS maintainers drafted an end-to-end “release management” document which includes the policies and procedures used for each NATS server release, everything from initial scoping to communication of the release itself.
