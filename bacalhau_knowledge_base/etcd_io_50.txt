command line, and source codeThis document defines the various terms used in etcd documentation, command line and source code.AlarmThe etcd server raises an alarm whenever the cluster needs operator intervention to remain reliable.AuthenticationAuthentication manages user access permissions for etcd resources.ClientA client connects to the etcd cluster to issue service requests such as fetching key-value pairs, writing data, or watching for updates.ClusterCluster consists of several members.The node in each member follows raft consensus protocol to replicate logs. Cluster receives proposals from members, commits them and apply to local store.CompactionCompaction discards all etcd event history and superseded keys prior to a given revision. It is used to reclaim storage space in the etcd backend database.ElectionThe etcd cluster holds elections among its members to choose a leader as part of the raft consensus protocol.EndpointA URL pointing to an etcd service or resource.KeyA user-defined identifier for storing and retrieving user-defined values in etcd.Key rangeA set of keys containing either an individual key, a lexical interval for all x such that a < x <= b, or all keys greater than a given key.KeyspaceThe set of all keys in an etcd cluster.LeaseA short-lived renewable contract that deletes keys associated with it on its expiry.MemberA logical etcd server that participates in serving an etcd cluster.Modification RevisionThe first revision to hold the last write to a given key.PeerPeer is another member of the same cluster.ProposalA proposal is a request (for example a write request, a configuration change request) that needs to go through raft protocol.QuorumThe number of active members needed for consensus to modify the cluster state. etcd requires a member majority to reach quorum.RevisionA 64-bit cluster-wide counter that starts at 1 and is incremented each time the keyspace is modified.RoleA unit of permissions over a set of key ranges which may be granted to a set of users for access control.SnapshotA point-in-time backup of the etcd cluster state.StoreThe physical storage backing the cluster keyspace.TermA term is a monotonically increasing integer that is associated with each leader election in the Raft algorithm.
For a term there can only be one elected leader and term is incremented on leader change.TransactionAn atomically executed set of operations. All modified keys in a transaction share the same modification revision.Key VersionThe number of writes to a key since it was created, starting at 1. The version of a nonexistent or deleted key is 0.WatcherA client opens a watcher to observe updates on a given key range.FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it!
