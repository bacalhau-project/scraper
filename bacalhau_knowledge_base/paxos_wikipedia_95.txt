She is one of the inventors ofdifferential privacyandproof-of-work.Dwork works atHarvard University, where she is Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science, Radcliffe Alumnae Professor at theRadcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and Affiliated Professor atHarvard Law Schooland Harvard's Department of Statistics.Dwork was elected a member of theNational Academy of Engineeringin 2008 for fundamental contributions to distributed algorithms and the security of cryptosystems.Early life and education[edit]Dwork received her B.S.E. fromPrinceton Universityin 1979, graduating Cum Laude, and receiving the Charles Ira Young Award for Excellence in Independent Research.
Dwork received her Ph.D. fromCornell Universityin 1983[3]for research supervised byJohn Hopcroft.[4][2]Career and research[edit]Dwork is known for her research placing privacy-preserving data analysis on a mathematically rigorous foundation, including the invention ofdifferential privacyin the early to mid 2000s, a strong privacy guarantee frequently permitting highly accurate data analysis.[5]The definition of differential privacy relies on the notion of indistinguishability of the outputs irrespective of whether an individual has contributed their data or not. This is typically achieved by adding small amounts of noise either to the input data or to outputs of computations performed on the data.[6]She uses a systems-based approach to studying fairness in algorithms including those used for placing ads.[7]Dwork has also made contributions incryptographyanddistributed computing, and is a recipient of theEdsger W. Dijkstra Prizefor her early work on the foundations offault-tolerant systems.[8]Her contributions in cryptography includenon-malleable cryptographywithDanny DolevandMoni Naorin 1991, the firstlattice-basedcryptosystem withMiklós Ajtaiin 1997, which was also the firstpublic-key cryptosystemfor which breaking a random instance is as hard as solving the hardest instance of the underlying mathematical problem ("worst-case/average-case equivalence"). With Naor she also first presented the idea of, and a technique for, combatinge-mail spamby requiring a proof of computational effort, also known asproof-of-work— a key technology underlyinghashcashandbitcoin.Selected works[edit]Her publications[1]include:Dwork, Cynthia;Lynch, Nancy;Stockmeyer, Larry(1988). "Consensus in the presence of partial synchrony".Journal of the ACM.35(2): 288–323.CiteSeerX10.1.1.13.3423.doi:10.1145/42282.42283.S2CID17007235.— this paper received theDijkstra Prizein 2007.Dwork, Cynthia; Roth, Aaron (2014).The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy(PDF). Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science. Now Publishers.ISBN978-1601988188.Awards and honors[edit]She was elected as a Fellow of theAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences(AAAS) in 2008,[9][10]as a member of theNational Academy of Engineeringin 2008, as a member of theNational Academy of Sciencesin 2014, as afellowof theAssociation for Computing Machinery(ACM) in 2015,[11]and as a member of theAmerican Philosophical Societyin 2016.[12]Dwork received a number of awards for her work.In 2007, she received her first test-of-time, theDijkstra Prize, for her work onconsensusproblems together withNancy LynchandLarry Stockmeyer.[13][14]In 2009, she won the PET Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies.[15]In 2016, both theInternational Association for Cryptologic Research2016 TCC Test-of-Time Award[16]and the 2017Gödel Prizewere awarded to Cynthia Dwork,Frank McSherry,Kobbi NissimandAdam D. Smithfor their seminal paper that introduced differential privacy.[17]In 2020, she received theIEEE Richard W. Hamming Medalfor "foundational work in privacy, cryptography, and distributed computing, and for leadership in developing differential privacy."[18]She is the 2020 winner of theKnuth Prize.[19]She is a co-winner of the 2021 ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for her and her co-authors' "fundamental contributions to the development of differential privacy".[20]She is co-winner of the 2022 RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics for "contributions to the foundation of privacy and to the foundations of cryptography".[21]In 2022, her 1991STOCpaper, with Dolev and Naor, “Non-Malleable Cryptography,”[22]won aSTOC30-year Test-of Time award.[23]Personal life[edit]Dwork is the daughter of American mathematicianBernard Dwork, and sister of historianDebórah Dwork.[citation needed]She has ablack beltintaekwondo.[24]References[edit]^abCynthia Dworkpublications indexed byGoogle Scholar^abCynthia Dworkat theMathematics Genealogy Project^abDwork, Cynthia (1983).Bounds on Fundamental Problems in Parallel and Distributed Computation.cornell.edu(PhD thesis).
