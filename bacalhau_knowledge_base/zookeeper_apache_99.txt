Note: this is for your reference only, and you need to adjust them according to your actual situation and resource environmentuse ./promtool check rules rules/zk.yml to check the correctness of the config file

You candownloadthe open source version or create afreeaccount on InfluxDB Cloud. In either case, configure theApache Zookeeper Telegraf pluginto start collecting and storing metrics from your Zookeeper clusters into your InfluxDB instance. There is also anApache Zookeeper InfluxDB templatethat includes the Telegraf configurations and a dashboard to get you set up right away.JMXMore details can be found inhereFour letter wordsMore details can be found inhereCopyright ©The Apache Software Foundation.
