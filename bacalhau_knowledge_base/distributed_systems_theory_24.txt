Paper TrailBlogSomething a bit different: translations of classic mathematical texts (!)August 04, 2012During his retirement, my father has been able to spend much time indulging his love of mathematics. This included, amongst other impressive endeavours, attending Cambridge at a more advanced age than average to take (and pass!) thePart III of the Mathematical Tripos, often considered one of the hardest taught courses in maths in the world.Since then, he has hardly been idle, and has recently been undertaking a translation of a classic work in modern algebra byDedekindandWeberfrom its original 100+ pages of German into English.Having completed this monumental piece of work, it seemed only proper to share it a little more widely so that other students might benefit from his efforts - and that’s where I come in, since I’m the one with the website. So if you have any passing interest in 19th / 20th century modern algebra, I encourage you to check out Noel Robinson’stranslation of “Theory of Algebraic Functions of One Variable”, hosted on this site.©  - 2023 ·Paper Trail·
