ISSNs are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature.[2]The ISSN system was first drafted as anInternational Organization for Standardization(ISO)international standardin 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975.[3]ISO subcommitteeTC 46/SC 9is responsible for maintaining the standard.When a serial with the samecontentis published in more than onemedia type, a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both inprintandelectronic media. The ISSN system refers to these types asprint ISSN(p-ISSN) andelectronic ISSN(e-ISSN).[4]Consequently, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned alinking ISSN(ISSN-L), typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium.[5]Code format[edit]An ISSN is an eight-digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers.[1]The last digit, which may be zero through nine or an X, is acheck digit, so the ISSN is uniquely represented by its first seven digits. Formally, the general form of the ISSN (also named "ISSN structure" or "ISSN syntax") can be expressed as follows:[6]NNNN-NNNCwhereNis in the set {0,1,2,...,9}, a decimal digit character, andCis in {0,1,2,...,9,X}; or by aPerl Compatible Regular Expressions(PCRE)regular expression:^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3}[0-9X]$.For example, the ISSN of the journalHearing Research, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, that isC=5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used:Each of the first seven digits of the ISSN is multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right, that is, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, respectively, and the resulting products are added:0⋅8+3⋅7+7⋅6+8⋅5+5⋅4+9⋅3+5⋅2=0+21+42+40+20+27+10=160.{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&0\cdot 8+3\cdot 7+7\cdot 6+8\cdot 5+5\cdot 4+9\cdot 3+5\cdot 2\\&=0+21+42+40+20+27+10\\&=160\;.\end{aligned}}}Theremainderof this summodulo11 is then calculated:16011=14remainder6=14+611{\displaystyle {\frac {160}{11}}=14{\mbox{ remainder }}6=14+{\frac {6}{11}}}If there is no remainder, the check digit is 0; otherwise the remainder is subtracted from 11. If the result is less than 10, it yields the check digit:11−6=5.{\displaystyle 11-6=5\;.}Thus, in this example, the check digitCis 5.If the result is 10 (that is, if the remainder is 1), the check digit is an uppercase X (like aRoman ten).To confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by their position in the number, counting from the right. (If the check digit is X, add 10 to the sum.) The remainder of the sum modulo 11 must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN, based on the above algorithm.[7]In EANs[edit]ISSNs can be encoded inEAN-13 bar codeswith a 977 "country code" (compare the 978 country code ("bookland") forISBNs), followed by the 7 main digits of the ISSN (the check digit is not included), followed by 2 publisher-defined digits, followed by the EAN check digit (which need not match the ISSN check digit).[8]Code assignment, maintenance and look-up[edit]ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres, usually located atnational librariesand coordinated by theISSN International Centrebased inParis. The International Centre is anintergovernmental organizationcreated in 1974 through an agreement betweenUNESCOand the French government.Linking ISSN[edit]ISSN-Lis aunique identifierfor all versions of the serial containing the samecontentacross different media. As defined byISO 3297:2007, the "linking ISSN (ISSN-L)" provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource. TheISSN-Lis one of a serial's existing ISSNs, so does not change the use or assignment of "ordinary" ISSNs;[9]it is based on the ISSN of the first published medium version of the publication. If the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time, the ISSN of the print version is chosen as the basis of theISSN-L.WithISSN-Lis possible to designate one single ISSN for all those media versions of the title. The use ofISSN-Lfacilitates search, retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services likeOpenURL,library catalogues,search enginesorknowledge bases.Register[edit]The International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, theISDS Register(International Serials Data System), otherwise known as theISSN Register. At the end of 2016,[update]the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items.[10]The Register is not freely available for interrogation on the web, but is available by subscription.The print version of a serial typically will include the ISSN code as part of the publication information.Most serial websites contain ISSN code information.Derivative lists of publications will often contain ISSN codes; these can be found through on-line searches with the ISSN code itself or serial title.WorldCatpermits searching its catalog by ISSN, by entering "issn:" before the code in the query field. One can also go directly to an ISSN's record by appending it to "https://www.worldcat.org/ISSN/", e.g.n2:1021-9749 – Search Results. This does not query the ISSN Register itself, but rather shows whether any WorldCat library holds an item with the given ISSN.Comparison with other identifiers[edit]ISSN andISBNcodes are similar in concept, where ISBNs are assigned to individualbooks. An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing noinformationas to thepublisheror itslocation. For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change.Extensions[edit]Since the ISSN applies to an entire serial, other identifiers have been built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components (like thetable of contents): thePublisher Item Identifier(PII) and theSerial Item and Contribution Identifier(SICI).Media versus content[edit]Separate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media (except reproductionmicroforms). Thus, theprintandelectronic mediaversions of a serial need separate ISSNs,[11]andCD-ROMversions andwebversions require different ISSNs. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats (e.g.PDFandHTML) of the same online serial.This "media-oriented identification" of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, and the Web, it makes sense to consider onlycontent, independent of media. This "content-oriented identification" of serials was arepressed demandduring a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials' contents model arrived with theindecs Content Modeland its application, thedigital object identifier(DOI), an ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s.Only later, in 2007, ISSN-L was defined in the new ISSN standard (ISO 3297:2007) as an "ISSN designated by the ISSN Network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media".[12]Use in URNs[edit]An ISSN can be encoded as auniform resource name(URN) by prefixing it with "urn:ISSN:".[6]For example,Railcould be referred to as "urn:ISSN:0953-4563". URN namespaces are case-sensitive, and the ISSN namespace is all caps.[13]If the checksum digit is "X" then it is always encoded in uppercase in a URN.Problems[edit]The URNs arecontent-oriented, but ISSN is media-oriented:ISSN is not uniquewhen the concept is "a journal is a set of contents, generally copyrighted content": the same journal (same contents and same copyrights) may have two or more ISSN codes. A URN needs to point to "unique content" (a "unique journal" as a "set of contents" reference).Example:Naturehas an ISSN for print, 0028-0836, and another for the same content on the Web, 1476-4687; only the oldest (0028-0836) is used as aunique identifier. As the ISSN is not unique, theU.S. National Library of Medicineneeded to create, prior to 2007, the NLM Unique ID (JID).[14]ISSNdoes not offerresolution mechanismslike adigital object identifier(DOI) or a URN does, so the DOI is used as a URN for articles, with (for historical reasons) no need for an ISSN's existence.Example: the DOI name "10.1038/nature13777" can be represented as an HTTP string byhttps://doi.org/10.1038/nature13777, and isredirected(resolved) to the current article's page; but there is no ISSN online service, likehttp://dx.issn.org/, to resolve the ISSN of the journal (in this sample1476-4687).A unique URN for serials simplifies the search, recovery and delivery of data for various services including, in particular,search systemsandknowledge databases.[12]ISSN-L(seeLinking ISSNabove) was created to fill this gap.Media category labels[edit]The two standard categories of media in which serials are most available areprintandelectronic. Inmetadatacontexts (e.g.,JATS), these may have standard labels.Print ISSN[edit]p-ISSNis a standard label for "Print ISSN", the ISSN for theprint media(paper) version of a serial. Usually it is the "default media" and so the "default ISSN".Electronic ISSN[edit]e-ISSN(oreISSN) is a standard label for "Electronic ISSN", the ISSN for theelectronic media(online) version of a serial.[15]ROAD[edit]ROAD: Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources[it](est. 2013), produced by theISSN International CentreandUNESCO[16]See also[edit]CODENWorldCat—an ISSN-resolve serviceReferences[edit]^ab"What is an ISSN?".
