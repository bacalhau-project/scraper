She is the NEC Professor of Software Science and Engineering in theEECSdepartment and heads the "Theory of Distributed Systems" research group at MIT'sComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.Education and early life[edit]Lynch was born inBrooklyn, and her academic training was in mathematics. She attendedBrooklyn Collegeand MIT, where she received herPh.D.in 1972 under the supervision ofAlbert R. Meyer.[2][3]Work[edit]She served on the math and computer science faculty at several other universities, includingTufts University, theUniversity of Southern California,Florida International University, and theGeorgia Institute of Technology(Georgia Tech), prior to joining the MIT faculty in 1982. Since then, she has been working on applying mathematics to the tasks of understanding and constructing complex distributed systems.Her 1985 work withMichael J. FischerandMike Paterson[4]onconsensus problemsreceived thePODC Influential-Paper Awardin 2001.[5]Their work showed that in an asynchronous distributed system, consensus is impossible if there is one processor that crashes. On their contribution,Jennifer Welchwrote that "this result has had a monumental impact in distributed computing, both theory and practice. Systems designers were motivated to clarify their claims concerning under what circumstances the systems work."[5]She is the author of numerous research articles about distributed algorithms and impossibility results, and about formal modeling and validation of distributed systems (see, e.g.,input/output automaton). She is the author of the graduate textbook "Distributed Algorithms".[6]She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, theNational Academy of Engineering, and an ACM Fellow.[7]Recognition[edit]1997:ACM Fellow2001:Dijkstra Paper Prizeof PODC conference2001: Elected a member of theNational Academy of Engineeringfor the development of theoretical foundations for distributed computing.[8]2006:Van Wijngaarden Award2007:Knuth Prize2007:Dijkstra Paper Prizeof PODC conference2010:IEEE Emanuel R.
