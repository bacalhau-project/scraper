These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including thepersonal computer,video game console, orsmartphonesand other mobile devices.MMOs can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing manyvideo game genres.History[edit]Main article:History of massively multiplayer online gamesThe most popular type of MMOG, and the subgenre that pioneered the category, is themassively multiplayer online role-playing game(MMORPG), which descended from universitymainframe computerMUDand adventure games such asRogueandDungeonon thePDP-10. These games predate the commercial gaming industry and the Internet, but still featured persistent worlds and other elements of MMOGs still used today.The first graphical MMOG, and a major milestone in the creation of the genre, was the multiplayer flight combat simulation gameAir WarriorbyKesmaion theGEnieonline service, which first appeared in 1986. Kesmai later added 3D graphics to the game, making it the first 3D MMO.Commercial MMORPGs gained acceptance in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The genre was pioneered by theGemStoneseries on GEnie, also created by Kesmai, andNeverwinter Nights, the first such game to include graphics, which debuted onAOLin 1991.[citation needed]Asvideo game developersapplied MMOG ideas to othercomputer and video game genres, new acronyms started to develop, such asMMORTS.MMOGemerged as a generic term to cover this growing class of games.The debuts ofThe Realm Online,Meridian 59(the first 3D MMORPG),Castle Infinity(the first kid-focused MMORPG),Ultima Online,UnderlightandEverQuestin the late 1990s popularized the MMORPG genre. The growth in technology meant that where Neverwinter Nights in 1991 had been limited to 50 simultaneous players (a number that grew to 500 by 1995), by 2000 a multitude of MMORPGs was each serving thousands of simultaneous players and led the way for games such asWorld of WarcraftandEVE Online.Despite the genre's focus on multiplayer gaming,AI-controlled characters are still common.NPCsandmobswho give out quests or serve as opponents are typical in MMORPGs. AI-controlled characters are not as common in action-based MMOGs.The popularity of MMOGs was mostly restricted to the computer game market until thesixth-generation consoles, with the launch ofPhantasy Star OnlineonDreamcastand the emergence and growth of online serviceXbox Live. There have been a number of console MMOGs, includingEverQuest Online Adventures(PlayStation 2), and the multiconsoleFinal Fantasy XI. On PCs, the MMOG market has always been dominated by successfulfantasyMMORPGs.MMOGs have only recently[when?]begun to break into the mobile phone market. The first,Samurai Romanesqueset in feudalJapan, was released in 2001 onNTT DoCoMo'siModenetwork in Japan.[2]More recent developments areCipSoft'sTibiaMEand Biting Bit'sMicroMonsterwhich features online and bluetooth multiplayer gaming.SmartCell Technologyis in development of Shadow of Legend, which will allow gamers to continue their game on their mobile device when away from their PC.Science fictionhas also been a popular theme, featuring games such asMankind,Anarchy Online,Eve Online,Star Wars GalaxiesandThe Matrix Online.MMOGs emerged from the hard-core gamer community to the mainstream strongly in December 2003 with an analysis in theFinancial Timesmeasuring the value of the virtual property in the then-largest MMOG, EverQuest, to result in a per-capita GDP of 2,266 dollars which would have placed the virtual world of EverQuest as the 77th wealthiest nation, on par with Croatia, Ecuador, Tunisia or Vietnam.World of Warcraftis a dominant MMOG with 8-9 million monthly subscribers worldwide.[when?][citation needed]The subscriber base dropped by 1 million after the expansionWrath of the Lich King, bringing it to 9 million subscribers in 2010,[3]though it remained the most popular Western title among MMOGs. In 2008, Westernconsumer spendingonWorld of Warcraftrepresented a 58% share of the subscription MMOG market in 2009.[4]The title has generated over $2.2 billion in cumulative consumer spending on subscriptions from 2005 through 2009.[4]Virtual economies[edit]Main article:Virtual economyWithin a majority of the MMOGs created, there is virtual currency where the player can earn and accumulate money. The uses for such virtual currency are numerous and vary from game to game. Thevirtual economiescreated within MMOGs often blur the lines between real and virtual worlds. The result is often seen as an unwanted interaction between the real and virtual economies by the players and the provider of the virtual world. This practice (economy interaction) is mostly seen in this genre of games. The two seem to come hand in hand with even the earliest MMOGs such asUltima Onlinehaving this kind of trade, real money for virtual things.The importance of having a working virtual economy within an MMOG is increasing as they develop. A sign of this isCCP Gameshiring the first real-life economist for its MMOGEve Onlineto assist and analyze the virtual economy and production within this game.The results of this interaction between the virtual economy, and our real economy, which is really the interaction between the company that created the game and the third-party companies that want a share of the profits and success of the game. This battle between companies is defended on both sides. The company originating the game and the intellectual property argue that this is in violation of the terms and agreements of the game as well as copyright violation since they own the rights to how the online currency is distributed and through what channels[citation needed]. The case that the third-party companies and their customers defend, is that they are selling and exchanging the time and effort put into the acquisition of the currency, not the digital information itself. They also express that the nature of many MMOGs is that they require time commitments not available to everyone. As a result, without external acquisition of virtual currency, some players are severely limited to being able to experience certain aspects of the game.The practice of acquiring large volumes of virtual currency for the purpose of selling to other individuals for tangible and real currency is calledgold farming. Many players who have poured in all of their personal effort resent that there is this exchange between real and virtual economies since it devalues their own efforts. As a result, the term 'gold farmer' now has a very negative connotation within the games and their communities. This slander has unfortunately also extended itself to racial profiling and to in-game and forum insulting.The reaction from many of the game companies varies. In games that are substantially less popular and have a small player base, the enforcement of the elimination of 'gold farming' appears less often. Companies in this situation most likely are concerned with their personal sales and subscription revenue over the development of their virtual economy, as they most likely have a higher priority to the games viability via adequate funding. Games with an enormous player base, and consequently much higher sales and subscription income, can take more drastic actions more often and in much larger volumes. This account banning could also serve as an economic gain for these large games, since it is highly likely that, due to demand, these 'gold farming' accounts will be recreated with freshly bought copies of the game.The virtual goods revenue from online games and social networking exceeded US$7 billion in 2010.[5]In 2011, it was estimated that up to 100,000 people in China and Vietnam are playing online games to gather gold and other items for sale to Western players.[6]While this 'gold farming' is considered to ruin the game for actual players, many rely on 'gold farming' as their main source of income.[citation needed]However single player in MMOs is quite viable, especially in what is called 'player vs environment' gameplay. This may result in the player being unable to experience all content, as many of the most significant and potentially rewarding game experiences are events that require large and coordinated teams to complete.Technical aspect[edit]Most MMOGs also share other characteristics that make them different from other multiplayer online games. MMOGs host many players in a single game world, and all of those players can interact with each other at any given time. Popular MMOGs might have thousands of players online at any given time, usually on company-owned servers. Non-MMOGs, such asBattlefield 1942orHalf-Lifeusually have fewer than 50 players online (per server) and are usually played on private servers. Also, MMOGs usually do not have any significantmodssince the game must work on company servers. There is some debate if a high head-count is a requirement to be an MMOG. Some say that it is the size of the game world and its capability to support many players that should matter. For example, despite technology and content constraints, most MMOGs can fit up to a few thousand players on a single game server at a time.To support all those players, MMOGs need large-scale game worlds, andserversto connect players to those worlds. Some games have all of their servers connected so all players are connected in ashared universe. Others have copies of their starting game world put on different servers, called "shards", for a sharded universe. Shards got their name from Ultima Online, where in the story, the shards of Mondain's gem created the duplicate worlds.Still, others will only use one part of the universe at any time. For example,Tribes(which is not an MMOG) comes with a number of large maps, which are played in rotation (one at a time). In contrast, the similar titlePlanetSideallows allmap-like areas of the game to be reached via flying, driving, or teleporting.MMORPGsusually have sharded universes, as they provide the most flexible solution to the server load problem, but not always. For example, the space simulationEve Onlineuses only one large cluster server peaking at over 60,000 simultaneous players.It is challenging to develop the database engines that are needed to run a successful MMOG with millions of players.[7]Many developers have created their own, but attempts have been made to createmiddleware, software that would help game developers concentrate on their games more than technical aspects. One such piece of middleware is calledBigWorld.An early, successful entry into the field was VR-1 Entertainment whose Conductor platform was adopted and endorsed by a variety of service providers around the world including Sony Communications Network in Japan; the Bertelsmann Game Channel in Germany; British Telecom'sWireplayin England; and DACOM and Samsung SDS in South Korea.[8]Games that were powered by the Conductor platform included Fighter Wing, Air Attack, Fighter Ace, Evernight, Hasbro Em@ail Games (Clue, NASCAR and Soccer), Towers of Fallow, The SARAC Project, VR1 Crossroads and Rumble in the Void.Typical MUDs and other predecessor games were limited to about 64 or 256 simultaneous player connections; this was a limit imposed by the underlying operating system, which was usually Unix-like. One of the biggest problems with modern engines has been handling the vast number of players. Since a typical server can handle around 10,000–12,000 players, 4000–5000 active simultaneously, dividing the game into several servers has up until now been the solution. This approach has also helped with technical issues, such aslag, that many players experience. Another difficulty, especially relevant to real-time simulation games, is time synchronization across hundreds or thousands of players. Many games rely on time synchronization to drive their physics simulation as well as their scoring and damage detection.Although there is no specific limit to where an online multiplayer online game is consideredmassive, there are broad features that are often used as a metric. Garriott's famed 1997 definition referred to the fundamental architecture shift required to support tens of thousands of concurrent players, which required shifting from individual servers to data centers on multiple continents. Games may have MMO features like large worlds with online persistence but still not generally be considered an MMO, such asGrand Theft Auto V's online play, while other games likeLeague of Legendshave small individual sessions but the global infrastructure requirements often allow for classification as an MMO.[9]The term is often used differently by players who tend to refer to their play experience versus game developers who refer to the engineering experience. MMO game developers tend to require tremendous investments in developing and maintaining servers around the globe, network bandwidth infrastructure often on the order of terabytes per second, and large engineering problems relating to managing data spread between multiple computer clusters.[10][11]Game types[edit]There are several types of massively multiplayer online games.Role-playing[edit]Main article:Massively multiplayer online role-playing gameSee also:List of MMORPGsMassively multiplayer onlinerole-playing games, known asMMORPGs, are the most common type of MMOG. Some MMORPGs are designed as amultiplayer browser gamein order to reduce infrastructure costs and utilise athin clientthat most users will already have installed. The acronymBBMMORPGs has sometimes been used to describe these asbrowser-based.Bulletin board role-playing games[edit]Many games are categorized as MMOBBGs,[citation needed], Massively Multiplayer Online Bulletin Board Games, also called MMOBBRPGs.[citation needed]These particular types of games are primarily made up of text and descriptions, although images are often used to enhance the game.First-person shooter[edit]Main article:Massively multiplayer online first-person shooter gameSee also:List of MMOFPSsMMOFPS is an online gaming genre which features many simultaneous players in afirst-person shooterfashion.[12][13]These games provide large-scale, sometimes team-based combat. The addition of persistence in the game world means that these games add elements typically found in RPGs, such asexperience points.[citation needed]However, MMOFPS games emphasize player skill more than player statistics, as no number of in-game bonuses will compensate for a player's inability to aim and think tactically.[14]Real-time strategy[edit]Main article:Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy gameSee also:List of MMORTSsMassively multiplayer onlinereal-time strategygames, also known as "MMORTS", combinereal-time strategy(RTS) with apersistent world. Players often assume the role of a general, king, or other types of figurehead leading an army into battle while maintaining the resources needed for such warfare.  The titles are often based in asci-fiorfantasyuniverse and are distinguished from single or small-scale multiplayer RTSes by the number of players and common use of a persistent world, generally hosted by the game's publisher, which continues to evolve even when the player is offline.Turn-based strategy[edit]See also:List of MMOTBSsSteve Jackson Games'UltraCorpsis an example of an MMO turn-based strategy game.[15]Hundreds of players share the same playing field of conquest.  In a "mega" game, each turn fleets are built and launched to expand one's personal empire.  Turns are usually time-based, with a "tick" schedule usually daily.  All orders are processed, and battles resolved,  at the same time during the tick. Similarly, inDarkwind: War on Wheels, vehicle driving and combat orders are submitted simultaneously by all players and a "tick" occurs typically once per 30 seconds. This allows each player to accurately control multiple vehicles and pedestrians in racing or combat.Simulations[edit]Some MMOGs have been designed to accurately simulate certain aspects of the real world. They tend to be very specific to industries or activities of very large risk and huge potential loss, such as rocket science, airplanes, trucks, battle tanks, submarines etc. Gradually as simulation technology is getting more mainstream, so too various simulators arrive into more mundane industries.The initial goal ofWorld War II Onlinewas to create a map (in northwestern Europe) that had real-world physics (gravity, air/water resistance, etc.), and ability for players to have some strategic abilities to its basic FPS/RPG role.  While the current version is not quite a true simulated world, it is very complex and contains a large persistent world.The MMOG genre of air traffic simulation is one example, with networks such asVATSIMandIVAOstriving to provide rigorously authenticflight-simulationenvironments to players in both pilot and air traffic controller roles.  In this category of MMOGs, the objective is to create duplicates of the real world for people who cannot or do not wish to undertake those experiences in real life.  For example, flight simulation via an MMOG requires far less expenditure of time and money, is completely risk-free, and is far less restrictive (fewer regulations to adhere to, no medical exams to pass, and so on).Another specialist area is the mobile telecoms operator (carrier) business where billion-dollar investments in networks are needed but market shares are won and lost on issues from segmentation to handset subsidies. A specialist simulation was developed by Nokia called Equilibrium/Arbitrage to have over a two-day period five teams of top management of one operator/carrier play a "wargame" against each other, under extremely realistic conditions, with one operator an incumbent fixed and mobile network operator, another a new entrant mobile operator, a third a fixed-line/internet operator, etc. Each team is measured by outperforming their rivals by market expectations of that type of player. Thus each player has drastically different goals, but within the simulation, any one team can win. Also to ensure maximum intensity, only one team can win. Telecoms senior executives who have taken the Equilibrium/Arbitrage simulation say it is the most intense, and most useful training they have ever experienced. It is typical of business use of simulators, in very senior management training/retraining.Examples of MMO simulation games includeWorld of Tanks,War Thunder,Motor City Online,The Sims Online, andJumpgate.Sports[edit]A massively multiplayer online sports game is a title where players can compete in some of the more traditional major league sports, such asfootball (soccer),basketball,baseball,hockey,golforAmerican football. According to GameSpot.com, Baseball Mogul Online was "the world's first massively multiplayer online sports game".[16]Other titles that qualify as MMOSG have been around since the early 2000s, but only after 2010 did they start to receive the endorsements of some of the official major league associations and players.Racing[edit]MMOR meansmassively multiplayer online racing.  Currently there are only a small number of racing-based MMOGs, includingiRacing,Kart Rider,Test Drive Unlimited,Project Torque,Drift CityandRace or Die. Other notable MMORs includedUpshift Strikeracer,Motor City OnlineandNeed for Speed: World, all of which have since shut down. TheTrackmaniaseries is the world's largest MMO racing game and holds the world record for "Most Players in a Single Online Race".[citation needed]AlthoughDarkwind: War on Wheelsis more combat-based than racing, it is also considered an MMOR.Casual[edit]Many types of MMO games can be classified ascasual, because they are designed to appeal to all computer users (as opposed to subgroup of frequent game buyers), or to fans of another game genre (such ascollectible card games). Such games are easy to learn and require a smaller time commitment than other game types. Other popular casual games include simple management games such asThe Sims OnlineorKung Fu Panda World.MMOPGs, or massively multiplayer online puzzle games, are based entirely on puzzle elements. 
They are usually set in a world where the players can access the puzzles around the world. Most games that are MMOPGs are hybrids with other genres.Castle Infinitywas the first MMOG developed for children.  Its gameplay falls somewhere betweenpuzzleandadventure.There are also massively multiplayer collectible card games:Alteil,Astral MastersandAstral Tournament. Other MMOCCGs might exist (Neopetshas some CCG elements) but are not as well known.Alternate reality games(ARGs) can be massively multiplayer, allowing thousands of players worldwide to co-operate in puzzle trials and mystery solving.  ARGs take place in a unique mixture of online and real-world play that usually does not involve apersistent world, and are not necessarily multiplayer, making them different from MMOGs.Music/rhythm[edit]Massively multiplayer online music/rhythm games (MMORGs), sometimes called massively multiplayer online dance games (MMODGs), are MMOGs that are alsomusic video games. This idea was influenced byDance Dance Revolution.Audition Onlineis another casual massively multiplayer online game and it is produced by T3 Entertainment.Just Dance 2014has a game mode called World Dance Floor, which also structures like an MMORPG.Social[edit]Massively multiplayer online social games (MMOSGs) focus on socialization instead of objective-based gameplay. There is a great deal of overlap in terminology with "online communities" and "virtual worlds". One example that has garnered widespread media attention is Linden Lab'sSecond Life, emphasizing socializing,worldbuildingand an in-world virtual economy that depends on the sale and purchase of user-created content. It is technically an MMOSG orCasual Multiplayer Online(CMO) by definition, though its stated goal was to realize[citation needed]the concept of theMetaversefromNeal Stephenson's novelSnow Crash.  Instead of being based around combat, one could say that it was based around the creation of virtual objects, including models and scripts.  In practice, it has more in common withClub CaribethanEverQuest.  It was the first MMO of its kind to achieve widespread success (including attention from mainstream media); however, it was not the first (asClub Caribewas released in 1988). Competitors in this subgenre (non-combat-based MMORPG) includeActive Worlds,There,SmallWorlds,Furcadia,Whirled,IMVUandRed Light Center.Many browser-based Casual MMOs have begun to spring up. This has been made easier because of maturing ofAdobe Flashand the popularity ofClub Penguin,Growtopia, andThe Sims Online.Combat[edit]Massively multiplayer online combat games are realtime objective, strategy and capture the flag style modes.Infantry Onlineis an example multiplayer combat video game with sprite animation graphics, using complex soldier, ground vehicle and space-ship models on typically complex terrains developed by Sony online entertainment.Research[edit]Some recent attempts to buildpeer-to-peer(P2P) MMOGs have been made.Outback Onlinemay be the first commercial one,[17]however, so far most of the efforts have been academic studies.[18]A P2P MMOG may potentially be more scalable and cheaper to build, but notable issues with P2P MMOGs include security and consistency control, which can be difficult to address given that clients are easily hacked. Some MMOGs such asVindictususe P2P networking and client-server networking together.In April 2004, theUnited States Armyannounced that it was developing a massively multiplayer training simulation calledAWE(asymmetric warfareenvironment). The purpose ofAWEis to train soldiers forurban warfareand there are no plans for a public commercial release.Forterra Systemsis developing it for the Army based on theThereengine.[19]In 2010,Bonnie Nardipublished an ethnographic study on World of Warcraft examined withLev Vygotsky'sactivity theory.As the field of MMOs grows larger each year, research has also begun to investigate the socio-informatic bind the games create for their users. In 2006, researchers Constance A. Steinkuehler and Dmitri Williams initiated research on such topics. The topic most intriguing to the pair was to further understand the gameplay, as well as the virtual world serving as a social meeting place, of popular MMOs.To further explore the effects ofsocial capitaland social relationships on MMOs, Steinkuehler and Williams combined conclusions from two different MMO research projects: sociocultural perspective on culture and cognition, and the other on media effects of MMOs. The conclusions of the two studies explained how MMOs function as a new form of a "third place" for informal social interactions much like coffee shops, pubs, and other typical hangouts. Many scholars, however, such as Oldenburg (1999), challenge the idea of a MMOs serving as a "third place" due to inadequate bridging social capital. His argument is challenged by Putnam (2000) who concluded that MMOs are well suited for the formation of bridging social capital, tentative relationships that lack in depth, because it is inclusive and serves as a sociological lubricant that is shown across the data collected in both of the research studies.[20]MMOs can also move past the "lubricant" stage and into the "superglue" stage known as bonding social capital, a closer relationship that is characterized by stronger connections and emotional support. The study concludes that MMOs function best as a bridging mechanism rather than a bonding one, similar to a "third place". Therefore, MMOs have the capacity and the ability to serve as a community that effectively socializes users just like a coffee shop or pub, but conveniently in the comfort of their home.[20]Spending[edit]British online gamers are outspending their German and French counterparts according to a study commissioned by Gamesindustry.com and TNS. The UK MMO-market is now worth £195 million in 2009 compared to the £165 million and £145 million spent by German and French online gamers.[21]The US gamers spend more, however,  spending about $3.8 billion overall on MMO games. $1.8 billion of that money is spent on monthly subscription fees. The money spent averages out to $15.10[when?]between both subscription and free-to-play MMO gamers. The study also found that 46% of 46 million players in the US pay real money to play MMO games.[22]Today's Gamers MMO Focus Report, published in March 2010, was commissioned by TNS and gamesindustry.com. A similar study for the UK market-only (UK National Gamers Survey Report)[23]was released in February 2010 by the same groups.See also[edit]Extended realityGame engineList of massively multiplayer online gamesMultiplayer video gameOnline gameSocial network gameVirtual worldReferences[edit]^Gose, Edward (August 2014).A Dissertation Submitted to the Graduate Division of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education(PDF).
