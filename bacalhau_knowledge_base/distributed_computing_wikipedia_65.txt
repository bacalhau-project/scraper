Peers are equally privileged,equipotentparticipants in the network, forming a peer-to-peer network ofnodes.[1]In addition, apersonal area network(PAN) is also in nature a type ofdecentralizedpeer-to-peer network typically between two devices.[2]The opposite of a peer-to-peer network: based on theclient–server model, where individualclientsrequest services and resources from centralizedserversPeers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage, ornetwork bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.[3]Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditionalclient–server modelin which the consumption and supply of resources are divided.[4]While P2P systems had previously been used in manyapplication domains,[5]the architecture was popularized by theInternetfile sharing systemNapster, originally released in 1999.[6]P2P is used in many protocols such asBitTorrentfile sharing over the Internet[7]and inpersonal networkslikeMiracastdisplaying andBluetoothradio.[8]The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. In such social contexts,peer-to-peer as a memerefers to theegalitariansocial networkingthat has emerged throughout society, enabled byInternettechnologies in general.Development[edit]SETI@homewas established in 1999.While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains,[5]the concept was popularized byfile sharingsystems such as the music-sharing applicationNapster. The peer-to-peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect "directly, forming groups and collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual supercomputers, and filesystems".[9]The basic concept of peer-to-peer computing was envisioned in earlier software systems and networking discussions, reaching back to principles stated in the firstRequest for Comments, RFC 1.[10]Tim Berners-Lee's vision for theWorld Wide Webwas close to a P2P network in that it assumed each user of the web would be an active editor and contributor, creating and linking content to form an interlinked "web" of links. The early Internet was more open than the present day, where two machines connected to the Internet could send packets to each other without firewalls and other security measures.[11][9][page needed]This contrasts with thebroadcasting-like structure of the web as it has developed over the years.[12][13][14]As a precursor to the Internet,ARPANETwas a successful peer-to-peer network where "every participating node could request and serve content". However, ARPANET was not self-organized, and it could not "provide any means for context or content-based routing beyond 'simple' address-based routing."[14]Therefore,Usenet, a distributed messaging system that is often described as an early peer-to-peer architecture, was established. It was developed in 1979 as a system that enforces adecentralized modelof control.[15]The basic model is aclient–servermodel from the user or client perspective that offers a self-organizing approach to newsgroup servers. However,news serverscommunicate with one another as peers to propagate Usenet news articles over the entire group of network servers. The same consideration applies toSMTPemail in the sense that the core email-relaying network ofmail transfer agentshas a peer-to-peer character, while the periphery ofEmail clientsand their direct connections is strictly a client-server relationship.[16]In May 1999, with millions more people on the Internet,Shawn Fanningintroduced the music and file-sharing application called Napster.[14]Napster was the beginning of peer-to-peer networks, as we know them today, where "participating users establish a virtual network, entirely independent from the physical network, without having to obey any administrative authorities or restrictions".[14]Architecture[edit]A peer-to-peer network is designed around the notion of equalpeernodes simultaneously functioning as both "clients" and "servers" to the other nodes on the network.[17]This model of network arrangement differs from theclient–servermodel where communication is usually to and from a central server. A typical example of a file transfer that uses the client-server model is theFile Transfer Protocol(FTP) service in which the client and server programs are distinct: the clients initiate the transfer, and the servers satisfy these requests.Routing and resource discovery[edit]Peer-to-peer networks generally implement some form of virtualoverlay networkon top of the physical network topology, where the nodes in the overlay form asubsetof the nodes in the physical network.[18]Data is still exchanged directly over the underlyingTCP/IPnetwork, but at theapplication layerpeers can communicate with each other directly, via the logical overlay links (each of which corresponds to a path through the underlying physical network). Overlays are used for indexing and peer discovery, and make the P2P system independent from the physical network topology. Based on how the nodes are linked to each other within the overlay network, and how resources are indexed and located, we can classify networks asunstructuredorstructured(or as a hybrid between the two).[19][20][21]Unstructured networks[edit]Overlay network diagram for anunstructured P2P network, illustrating the ad hoc nature of the connections between nodesUnstructured peer-to-peer networksdo not impose a particular structure on the overlay network by design, but rather are formed by nodes that randomly form connections to each other.[22](Gnutella,Gossip, andKazaaare examples of unstructured P2P protocols).[23]Because there is no structure globally imposed upon them, unstructured networks are easy to build and allow for localized optimizations to different regions of the overlay.[24]Also, because the role of all peers in the network is the same, unstructured networks are highly robust in the face of high rates of "churn"—that is, when large numbers of peers are frequently joining and leaving the network.[25][26]However, the primary limitations of unstructured networks also arise from this lack of structure. In particular, when a peer wants to find a desired piece of data in the network, the search query must be flooded through the network to find as many peers as possible that share the data. Flooding causes a very high amount of signaling traffic in the network, uses moreCPU/memory (by requiring every peer to process all search queries), and does not ensure that search queries will always be resolved. Furthermore, since there is no correlation between a peer and the content managed by it, there is no guarantee that flooding will find a peer that has the desired data. Popular content is likely to be available at several peers and any peer searching for it is likely to find the same thing. But if a peer is looking for rare data shared by only a few other peers, then it is highly unlikely that the search will be successful.[27]Structured networks[edit]Overlay network diagram for astructured P2P network, using adistributed hash table(DHT) to identify and locate nodes/resourcesInstructured peer-to-peer networksthe overlay is organized into a specific topology, and the protocol ensures that any node can efficiently.[28]search the network for a file/resource, even if the resource is extremely rare.[23]The most common type of structured P2P networks implement adistributed hash table(DHT),[4][29]in which a variant ofconsistent hashingis used to assign ownership of each file to a particular peer.[30][31]This enables peers to search for resources on the network using ahash table: that is, (key,value) pairs are stored in the DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key.[32][33]Distributed hash tablesHowever, in order to route traffic efficiently through the network, nodes in a structured overlay must maintain lists of neighbors[34]that satisfy specific criteria. This makes them less robust in networks with a high rate ofchurn(i.e. with large numbers of nodes frequently joining and leaving the network).[26][35]More recent evaluation of P2P resource discovery solutions under real workloads have pointed out several issues in DHT-based solutions such as high cost of advertising/discovering resources and static and dynamic load imbalance.[36]Notable distributed networks that use DHTs includeTixati, an alternative toBitTorrent'sdistributed tracker, theKad network, theStorm botnet, and theYaCy. Some prominent research projects include theChord project,Kademlia,PAST storage utility,P-Grid, a self-organized and emerging overlay network, andCoopNet content distribution system.[37]DHT-based networks have also been widely utilized for accomplishing efficient resource discovery[38][39]forgrid computingsystems, as it aids in resource management and scheduling of applications.Hybrid models[edit]Hybrid models are a combination of peer-to-peer and client–server models.[40]A common hybrid model is to have a central server that helps peers find each other.Spotifywas an example of a hybrid model [until 2014].[citation needed]There are a variety of hybrid models, all of which make trade-offs between the centralized functionality provided by a structured server/client network and the node equality afforded by the pure peer-to-peer unstructured networks. Currently, hybrid models have better performance than either pure unstructured networks or pure structured networks because certain functions, such as searching, do require a centralized functionality but benefit from the decentralized aggregation of nodes provided by unstructured networks.[41]CoopNet content distribution system[edit]CoopNet (Cooperative Networking)was a proposed system for off-loading serving to peers who have recentlydownloadedcontent, proposed by computer scientists Venkata N. Padmanabhan and Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai, working atMicrosoft ResearchandCarnegie Mellon University.[42][43]When aserverexperiences an increase in load it redirects incoming peers to other peers who have agreed tomirrorthe content, thus off-loading balance from the server. All of the information is retained at the server. This system makes use of the fact that the bottleneck is most likely in the outgoing bandwidth than theCPU, hence its server-centric design. It assigns peers to other peers who are 'close inIP' to its neighbors [same prefix range] in an attempt to use locality. If multiple peers are found with the samefileit designates that the node choose the fastest of its neighbors.Streaming mediais transmitted by having clientscachethe previous stream, and then transmit it piece-wise to new nodes.Security and trust[edit]Peer-to-peer systems pose unique challenges from acomputer securityperspective. Like any other form ofsoftware, P2P applications can containvulnerabilities. What makes this particularly dangerous for P2P software, however, is that peer-to-peer applications act as servers as well as clients, meaning that they can be more vulnerable toremote exploits.[44]Routing attacks[edit]Since each node plays a role in routing traffic through the network, malicious users can perform a variety of "routing attacks", ordenial of serviceattacks. Examples of common routing attacks include "incorrect lookup routing" whereby malicious nodes deliberately forward requests incorrectly or return false results, "incorrect routing updates" where malicious nodes corrupt the routing tables of neighboring nodes by sending them false information, and "incorrect routing network partition" where when new nodes are joining they bootstrap via a malicious node, which places the new node in a partition of the network that is populated by other malicious nodes.[44]Corrupted data and malware[edit]See also:Data validationandMalwareThe prevalence ofmalwarevaries between different peer-to-peer protocols.[45]Studies analyzing the spread of malware on P2P networks found, for example, that 63% of the answered download requests on thegnutellanetwork contained some form of malware, whereas only 3% of the content onOpenFTcontained malware. In both cases, the top three most common types of malware accounted for the large majority of cases (99% in gnutella, and 65% in OpenFT). Another study analyzing traffic on theKazaanetwork found that 15% of the 500,000 file sample taken were infected by one or more of the 365 differentcomputer virusesthat were tested for.[46]Corrupted data can also be distributed on P2P networks by modifying files that are already being shared on the network. For example, on theFastTracknetwork, theRIAAmanaged to introduce faked chunks into downloads and downloaded files (mostlyMP3files). Files infected with the RIAA virus were unusable afterwards and contained malicious code. The RIAA is also known to have uploaded fake music and movies to P2P networks in order to deter illegal file sharing.[47]Consequently, the P2P networks of today have seen an enormous increase of their security and file verification mechanisms. Modernhashing,chunk verificationand different encryption methods have made most networks resistant to almost any type of attack, even when major parts of the respective network have been replaced by faked or nonfunctional hosts.[48]Resilient and scalable computer networks[edit]See also:Wireless mesh networkandDistributed computingThe decentralized nature of P2P networks increases robustness because it removes thesingle point of failurethat can be inherent in a client–server based system.[49]As nodes arrive and demand on the system increases, the total capacity of the system also increases, and the likelihood of failure decreases. If one peer on the network fails to function properly, the whole network is not compromised or damaged. In contrast, in a typical client–server architecture, clients share only their demands with the system, but not their resources. In this case, as more clients join the system, fewer resources are available to serve each client, and if the central server fails, the entire network is taken down.Distributed storage and search[edit]Search results for the query "software libre" usingYaCy, a freedistributed search enginethat runs on a peer-to-peer network instead of making requests to centralized index serversThere are both advantages and disadvantages in P2P networks related to the topic of databackup, recovery, and availability. In a centralized network, the system administrators are the only forces controlling the availability of files being shared. If the administrators decide to no longer distribute a file, they simply have to remove it from their servers, and it will no longer be available to users. Along with leaving the users powerless in deciding what is distributed throughout the community, this makes the entire system vulnerable to threats and requests from the government and other large forces.For example,YouTubehas been pressured by theRIAA,MPAA, and entertainment industry to filter out copyrighted content. Although server-client networks are able to monitor and manage content availability, they can have more stability in the availability of the content they choose to host. A client should not have trouble accessing obscure content that is being shared on a stable centralized network. P2P networks, however, are more unreliable in sharing unpopular files because sharing files in a P2P network requires that at least one node in the network has the requested data, and that node must be able to connect to the node requesting the data. This requirement is occasionally hard to meet because users may delete or stop sharing data at any point.[50]In a P2P network, the community of users is entirely responsible for deciding which content is available. Unpopular files eventually disappear and become unavailable as fewer people share them. Popular files, however, are highly and easily distributed. Popular files on a P2P network are more stable and available than files on central networks. In a centralized network, a simple loss of connection between the server and clients can cause a failure, but in P2P networks, the connections between every node must be lost to cause a data-sharing failure. In a centralized system, the administrators are responsible for all data recovery and backups, while in P2P systems, each node requires its backup system. Because of the lack of central authority in P2P networks, forces such as the recording industry,RIAA,MPAA, and the government are unable to delete or stop the sharing of content on P2P systems.[51]Applications[edit]Content delivery[edit]In P2P networks, clients both provide and use resources. This means that unlike client–server systems, the content-serving capacity of peer-to-peer networks can actuallyincreaseas more users begin to access the content (especially with protocols such asBittorrentthat require users to share, refer a performance measurement study[52]). This property is one of the major advantages of using P2P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor.[53][54]File-sharing networks[edit]Peer-to-peer file sharingnetworks such asGnutella,G2, and theeDonkey networkhave been useful in popularizing peer-to-peer technologies. These advancements have paved the way forPeer-to-peer content delivery networksand services, including distributed caching systems like Correli Caches to enhance performance.[55]Furthermore, peer-to-peer networks have made possible the software publication and distribution, enabling efficient sharing ofLinux distributionand various games thoughle sharingnetworks.Copyright infringements[edit]Peer-to-peer networking involves data transfer from one user to another without using an intermediate server. Companies developing P2P applications have been involved in numerous legal cases, primarily in the United States, over conflicts withcopyrightlaw.[56]Two major cases areGrokstervs RIAAandMGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd..[57]In the last case, the Court unanimously held that defendant peer-to-peer file sharing companies Grokster and Streamcast could be sued for inducing copyright infringement.Multimedia[edit]TheP2PTVandPDTPprotocols are used in various peer-to-peer applications. Someproprietarymultimedia applications leverage a peer-to-peer network in conjunction with streaming servers to stream audio and video to their clients.Peercastingis employed for multicasting streams. Additionally, a project calledLionShare, undertaken byPennsylvania State University, MIT, andSimon Fraser University, aims to facilitate file sharing among educational institutions globally. Another notable program,Osiris, enables users to create anonymous and autonomous web portals that are distributed via a peer-to-peer network.Other P2P applications[edit]Torrent fileconnect peersDatis a distributed version-controlled publishing platform.I2P, is anoverlay networkused to browse the Internetanonymously. Unlike the related I2P, theTor networkis not itself peer-to-peer[dubious–discuss]; however, it can enable peer-to-peer applications to be built on top of it viaonion services.

TheU.S. Department of Defenseis conducting research on P2P networks as part of its modern network warfare strategy.[58]In May 2003,Anthony Tether, then director ofDARPA, testified that the United States military uses P2P networks.WebTorrentis a P2Pstreamingtorrent clientinJavaScriptfor use inweb browsers, as well as in theWebTorrent Desktopstandalone version that bridges WebTorrent andBitTorrentserverless networks.Microsoft, inWindows 10, uses a proprietary peer-to-peer technology called "Delivery Optimization" to deploy operating system updates using end-users' PCs either on the local network or other PCs. According to Microsoft's Channel 9, this led to a 30%-50% reduction in Internet bandwidth usage.[59]Artisoft'sLANtasticwas built as a peer-to-peer operating system where machines can function as both servers and workstations simultaneously.Hotline CommunicationsHotline Client was built with decentralized servers and tracker software dedicated to any type of files and continues to operate today.Cryptocurrenciesare peer-to-peer-baseddigital currenciesthat useblockchainsList of cryptocurrenciesList of blockchainsSocial implications[edit]Incentivizing resource sharing and cooperation[edit]TheBitTorrentprotocol: In this animation, the colored bars beneath all of the 7 clients in the upper region above represent the file being shared, with each color representing an individual piece of the file. After the initial pieces transfer from theseed(large system at the bottom), the pieces are individually transferred from client to client. The original seeder only needs to send out one copy of the file for all the clients to receive a copy.Cooperation among a community of participants is key to the continued success of P2P systems aimed at casual human users; these reach their full potential only when large numbers of nodes contribute resources. But in current practice, P2P networks often contain large numbers of users who utilize resources shared by other nodes, but who do not share anything themselves (often referred to as the "freeloader problem").Freeloading can have a profound impact on the network and in some cases can cause the community to collapse.[60]In these types of networks "users have natural disincentives to cooperate because cooperation consumes their own resources and may degrade their own performance".[61]Studying the social attributes of P2P networks is challenging due to large populations of turnover, asymmetry of interest and zero-cost identity.[61]A variety of incentive mechanisms have been implemented to encourage or even force nodes to contribute resources.[62][44]Some researchers have explored the benefits of enabling virtual communities to self-organize and introduce incentives for resource sharing and cooperation, arguing that the social aspect missing from today's P2P systems should be seen both as a goal and a means for self-organized virtual communities to be built and fostered.[63]Ongoing research efforts for designing effective incentive mechanisms in P2P systems, based on principles from game theory, are beginning to take on a more psychological and information-processing direction.Privacy and anonymity[edit]Some peer-to-peer networks (e.g.Freenet) place a heavy emphasis onprivacyandanonymity—that is, ensuring that the contents of communications are hidden from eavesdroppers, and that the identities/locations of the participants are concealed.Public key cryptographycan be used to provideencryption,data validation, authorization, and authentication for data/messages.Onion routingand othermix networkprotocols (e.g. Tarzan) can be used to provide anonymity.[64]Perpetrators oflive streaming sexual abuseand othercybercrimeshave used peer-to-peer platforms to carry out activities with anonymity.[65]Political implications[edit]Intellectual property law and illegal sharing[edit]Although peer-to-peer networks can be used for legitimate purposes, rights holders have targeted peer-to-peer over the involvement with sharing copyrighted material. Peer-to-peer networking involves data transfer from one user to another without using an intermediate server. Companies developing P2P applications have been involved in numerous legal cases, primarily in the United States, primarily over issues surroundingcopyrightlaw.[56]Two major cases areGrokstervs RIAAandMGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.[57]In both of the cases the file sharing technology was ruled to be legal as long as the developers had no ability to prevent the sharing of the copyrighted material.To establish criminal liability for the copyright infringement on peer-to-peer systems, the government must prove that the defendant infringed a copyright willingly for the purpose of personal financial gain or commercial advantage.[66]Fair useexceptions allow limited use of copyrighted material to be downloaded without acquiring permission from the rights holders. These documents are usually news reporting or under the lines of research and scholarly work. Controversies have developed over the concern of illegitimate use of peer-to-peer networks regarding public safety and national security. When a file is downloaded through a peer-to-peer network, it is impossible to know who created the file or what users are connected to the network at a given time. Trustworthiness of sources is a potential security threat that can be seen with peer-to-peer systems.[67]A study ordered by theEuropean Unionfound that illegal downloadingmaylead to an increase in overall video game sales because newer games charge for extra features or levels. The paper concluded that piracy had a negative financial impact on movies, music, and literature. The study relied on self-reported data about game purchases and use of illegal download sites. Pains were taken to remove effects of false and misremembered responses.[68][69][70]Network neutrality[edit]Peer-to-peer applications present one of the core issues in thenetwork neutralitycontroversy. Internet service providers (ISPs) have been known to throttle P2P file-sharing traffic due to its high-bandwidthusage.[71]Compared to Web browsing, e-mail or many other uses of the internet, where data is only transferred in short intervals and relative small quantities, P2P file-sharing often consists of relatively heavy bandwidth usage due to ongoing file transfers and swarm/network coordination packets. In October 2007,Comcast, one of the largest broadband Internet providers in the United States, started blocking P2P applications such asBitTorrent. Their rationale was that P2P is mostly used to share illegal content, and their infrastructure is not designed for continuous, high-bandwidth traffic.Critics point out that P2P networking has legitimate legal uses, and that this is another way that large providers are trying to control use and content on the Internet, and direct people towards aclient–server-based application architecture. The client–server model provides financial barriers-to-entry to small publishers and individuals, and can be less efficient for sharing large files. As a reaction to thisbandwidth throttling, several P2P applications started implementing protocol obfuscation, such as theBitTorrent protocol encryption. Techniques for achieving "protocol obfuscation" involves removing otherwise easily identifiable properties of protocols, such as deterministic byte sequences and packet sizes, by making the data look as if it were random.[72]The ISP's solution to the high bandwidth isP2P caching, where an ISP stores the part of files most accessed by P2P clients in order to save access to the Internet.Current research[edit]Researchers have used computer simulations to aid in understanding and evaluating the complex behaviors of individuals within the network. "Networking research often relies on simulation in order to test and evaluate new ideas. An important requirement of this process is that results must be reproducible so that other researchers can replicate, validate, and extend existing work."[73]If the research cannot be reproduced, then the opportunity for further research is hindered. "Even though new simulators continue to be released, the research community tends towards only a handful of open-source simulators. The demand for features in simulators, as shown by our criteria and survey, is high. Therefore, the community should work together to get these features in open-source software. This would reduce the need for custom simulators, and hence increase repeatability and reputability of experiments."[73]Popular simulators that were widely used in the past are NS2, OMNeT++, SimPy, NetLogo, PlanetLab, ProtoPeer, QTM, PeerSim, ONE, P2PStrmSim, PlanetSim, GNUSim, and Bharambe.[74]Besides all the above stated facts, there has also been work done on ns-2 open source network simulators. One research issue related to free rider detection and punishment has been explored using ns-2 simulator here.[75]See also[edit]Portal:InternetClient-to-client protocolClient–queue–clientCultural-historical activity theory(CHAT)Distributed Data Management ArchitectureEnd-to-end principleFriend-to-friendList of P2P protocolsPeer-to-peer energy tradingSemantic P2P networksSharing economySponsorChangeUSB dead dropWireless ad hoc networkReferences[edit]^Cope, James (2002-04-08)."What's a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network?".Computerworld.
