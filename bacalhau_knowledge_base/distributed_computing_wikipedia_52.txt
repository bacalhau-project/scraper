In contrast,centralized computingexists when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing is a trend in modern-day business environments. This is the opposite ofcentralized computing, which was prevalent during the early days of computers. 
A decentralized computer system has many benefits over a conventional centralizednetwork.[1]Desktop computershave advanced so rapidly, that their potential performance far exceeds the requirements of mostbusiness applications. This results in most desktop computers remainingidle(in relation to their full potential). A decentralized system can use the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency. However, it is debatable whether these networks increase overall effectiveness.All computers have to be updated individually with new software, unlike a centralized computer system. Decentralized systems still enablefile sharingand all computers can shareperipheralssuch asprintersandscannersas well asmodems, allowing all the computers in the network to connect to theinternet.A collection of decentralized computers systems are components of a larger computer network, held together by local stations of equal importance and capability. These systems are capable of running independently of each other.Origins of decentralized computing[edit]The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work ofDavid Chaum.[citation needed]During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known asMix Network. It provided an anonymous email communications network, which decentralized the authentication of the messages in a protocol that would become the precursor toOnion Routing, the protocol of theTOR browser. Through this initial development of an anonymous communications network, David Chaum applied his Mix Network philosophy to design the world's first decentralized payment system and patented it in 1980.[2]Later in 1982, for his PhD dissertation, he wrote about the need for decentralized computing services in the paper Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.[3]Chaum proposed an electronic payment system calledEcashin 1982. Chaum's companyDigiCashimplemented this system from 1990 until 1998.[non-primary source needed]Peer-to-peer[edit]Main article:Peer-to-peerBased on a "grid model" a peer-to-peer system, or P2P system, is a collection of applications run on several computers, which connect remotely to each other to complete a function or a task. There is no mainoperating systemto which satellite systems are subordinate. This approach tosoftware development(and distribution) affords developers great savings, as they don't have to create a central control point. An example application isLAN messagingwhich allows users to communicate without a central server.Peer-to-peer networks, where no entity controls an effective or controlling number of the network nodes, runningopen source softwarealso not controlled by any entity, are said to effect adecentralized network protocol. These networks are harder for outside actors to shut down, as they have no central headquarters.[4][better source needed]File sharing applications[edit]One of the most notable debates over decentralized computing involvedNapster, a musicfile sharingapplication, which granted users access to an enormous database of files.Record companiesbrought legal action against Napster, blaming the system for lost record sales. Napster was found in violation ofcopyrightlaws by distributingunlicensed software, and was shut down.[5]After the fall of Napster, there was demand for a file sharing system that would be less vulnerable tolitigation.Gnutella, a decentralized system, was developed. This system allowed files to be queried and shared between users without relying upon a centraldirectory, and this decentralization shielded the network from litigation related to the actions of individual users.Decentralized web[edit]This section is an excerpt fromDecentralized web.[edit]The decentralized web is a network of independentcomputersthat provide secure, censorship-resistant access to information and services without relying on centralserversorclouds, using decentralized computing.See also[edit]Centralized computingDistributed computingDecentralized information technologyDecentralized network 42Decentralized Autonomous OrganizationFederation (information technology)Federated social networkBlockchainDecentralized financeReferences[edit]^Pandl, Konstantin D.; Thiebes, Scott; Schmidt-Kraepelin, Manuel; Sunyaev, Ali (2020)."On the Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Distributed Ledger Technology: A Scoping Review and Future Research Agenda".IEEE Access.8: 57075–57095.arXiv:2001.11017.doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2981447.ISSN2169-3536.^Patent US4529870^Chaum, David.Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups^Croman, Kyle; Decker, Christian; Ittay, Eyal; Gencer, Adem Efe; Juels, Ari (31 August 2016)."On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains".International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security.
