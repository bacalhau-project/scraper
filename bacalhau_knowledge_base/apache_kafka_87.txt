This release contains many new features and improvements. This blog post will highlight some of the more prominent features. For a full list of changes, be sure to check therelease notes.See theUpgrading to 3.8.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.7.xsection in the documentation for the list of notable changes and detailed upgrade steps.In a previous release, 3.6,tiered storagewas released as early access feature.
                    In this release, Tiered Storage now supports clusters configured with multiple log directories (i.e. JBOD feature). This feature still remains as early access.In the last release, 3.7,KIP-858was released in early access. Since this version, JBOD in KRaft is no longer considered an early access feature.Up until now, only the default compression level was used by Apache Kafka. From this version on, a configuration mechanism to specify compression level is included. SeeKIP-390for more details.KIP-848 The Next Generation of the Consumer Rebalance Protocolis available as preview in 3.8. This version includes numerous bug
                    fixes and the community is encouraged to test and provide feedback.See the preview release notes for more information.The configuration valueoffsets.commit.required.acksis deprecated in this version and it will be removed in Kafka 4.0. SeeKIP-1041for more details.Note: ZooKeeper is marked as deprecated since the 3.5.0 release. ZooKeeper is planned to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. For more information, please see the documentation forZooKeeper Deprecation.Kafka Broker, Controller, Producer, Consumer and Admin ClientKIP-390: Support Compression Level:Adds a mechanism to specify compression level instead of relying on the default one.KIP-719: Deprecate Log4J Appender:Log4J Appender is now deprecated and it will be removed, most probably, in Kafka 4.0.(Preview) KIP-848 The Next Generation of the Consumer Rebalance Protocol:The new simplified Consumer Rebalance Protocol moves complexity away from the consumer and into the Group Coordinator within the broker and completely revamps the protocol to be incremental in nature. It provides the same guarantee as the current protocolââbut better and more efficient, including no longer relying on a global synchronization barrier.See the preview release notes for more information.KIP-899: Allow producer and consumer clients to rebootstrap:This KIP allows Kafka clients to repeat the bootstrap process when updating metadata if none of the known brokers are available.KIP-993: Allow restricting files accessed by File and Directory ConfigProviders:This KIP adds the ability to limit the files accessible to the file and directory configuration providers so the caller doesn't have unrestricted access.KIP-974: Docker Image for GraalVM based Native Kafka Broker:This update introduces the process to create Docker native image for Apache Kafka based onf GraalVM. The advantage of this Apache Kafka docker image that can launch brokers with sub-second startup time and minimal memory footprint by leveraging a GraalVM based native Kafka binary and runs in the Kraft mode.KIP-1018: Introduce max remote fetch timeout config for DelayedRemoteFetch requests:Introduces a new timeout parameter,remote.fetch.max.wait.ms, to offer users the option to configure the timeout based on their workload.KIP-1019: Expose method to determine Metric Measurability:This KIP introduces a new method,isMeasurable(), to theKafkaMetricclass, eliminating the need for accessing private fields or handling exceptions in case of non-measurable metrics.KIP-1028: Docker Official Image for Apache Kafka:This update introduces the official Docker image for Apache Kafka.KIP-1036: Extend RecordDeserializationException exception:KIP-334introduced into the Consumer the RecordDeserializationException with offsets information. That is useful to skip a poison pill but as you do not have access to the Record, it still prevents easy implementation of dead letter queue or simply logging the faulty data.KIP-1037: Allow WriteTxnMarkers API with Alter Cluster Permission:This KIP builds onKIP-98andKIP-664allowing theWriteTxnMarkersAPI to be invoked with the Alter permission on the cluster to reflect that this API is an admin operation that can be called from the Kafka Admin Client.KIP-1041: Drop `offsets.commit.required.acks` config in 4.0 (deprecate in 3.8):The configurationoffsets.commit.required.acksis deprecated and it will be removed in Kafka 4.0.KIP-1047 Introduce new org.apache.kafka.tools.api.Decoder to replace kafka.serializer.Decoder:This KIP deprecateskafka.serializer.Decoderand introducesorg.apache.kafka.tools.api.Decoderin oder to allow the migration of tool related code from core to the tools module.Kafka StreamsKIP-989: Improved StateStore Iterator metrics for detecting leaks:This KIP introduces several new metrics to aid users in finding leaked Iterators, as well as identifying the cause of a high number of pinned blocks, or other kinds of memory leaks and performance problems.KIP-924: customizable task assignment for Streams:This KIP adds a new group of configurable interfaces for plugging custom behaviour into the Streams Partition Assignor. This configuration supplants the existing internal task assignor config. Additionally, it limits the scope of these configs to supplying a custom task assignor. This opens the door for future KIPs to add further configs in which a user can set to plug in custom behavior.KIP-813: Shareable State Stores:This KIP adds Shareable State Stores, introducing the ability to use data within a state store across multiple applications without duplicating it on topic level.Kafka ConnectKIP-477: Add PATCH method for connector config in Connect REST API:This KIP adds the ability in Kafka Connect to understandPATCHmethods in the Connect REST API, allowing partial configuration updates.KIP-1004: Enforce tasks.max property in Kafka Connect:This KIP changes Kafka Connect so it respects the value for thetasks.maxproperty. Check the KIP description page for compatibility and migration plan.SummaryReady to get started with Apache Kafka 3.8.0?

This release contains many new features and improvements. This blog post will highlight some of the more prominent features. For a full list of changes, be sure to check therelease notes.See theUpgrading to 3.7.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.6.xsection in the documentation for the list of notable changes and detailed upgrade steps.In the last release, 3.6,the ability to migrate Kafka clusters from a ZooKeeper metadata systemto a KRaft metadata system was ready for usage in production environments with one caveat -- JBOD was not yet available for KRaft clusters.
                    In this release, we are shipping an early access release of JBOD in KRaft. (SeeKIP-858and therelease notesfor details).Additionally, client APIs released prior to Apache Kafka 2.1 are now marked deprecated in 3.7 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. SeeKIP-896for details and RPC versions that are now deprecated.Java 11 support for the Kafka broker is also marked deprecated in 3.7, and is planned to be removed in Kafka 4.0. SeeKIP-1013for more details. Note that clients can continue to use JDK >= 11 to connect to Kafka brokers.Note: ZooKeeper is marked as deprecated since the 3.5.0 release. ZooKeeper is planned to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. For more information, please see the documentation forZooKeeper Deprecation.Kafka Broker, Controller, Producer, Consumer and Admin Client(Early Access) KIP-858 Handle JBOD broker disk failure in KRaft:This update closes the gap on one of the last major missing features in KRaft by adding JBOD support in KRaft-based clusters. Note that it is not yet recommended for use in production environments. Please refer to therelease notesto help us test it and provide feedback atKAFKA-16061.KIP-714 Client metrics and observability:With KIP-714, operators get better visibility into the clients connecting to their cluster with broker-side support of client-level metrics via a standardized telemetry interface.KIP-1000 List Client Metrics Configuration Resources:KIP-1000 supports KIP-714 by introducing a way to create, read, update, and delete the client metrics configuration resources using the existing RPCs and the kafka-configs.sh tool.(Early Access) KIP-848 The Next Generation of the Consumer Rebalance Protocol:The new simplified Consumer Rebalance Protocol moves complexity away from the consumer and into the Group Coordinator within the broker and completely revamps the protocol to be incremental in nature. It provides the same guarantee as the current protocolââbut better and more efficient, including no longer relying on a global synchronization barrier.See the early access release notes for more information.KIP-951 Leader discovery optimisations for the client:KIP-951 optimizes the time it takes for a client to discover the new leader of a partition, leading to reduced end-to-end latency of produce/fetch requests in the presence of leadership changes (broker restarts, partition reassignments, etc.).KIP-975 Docker Image for Apache Kafka:Introduces an official Apache Kafka Docker image, enabling quicker testing and deployment, as well as onboarding of developers.KIP-580 Exponential Backoff for Kafka Clients:Changes the clientâs retry backoff time used for retrying failed requests from a static one to an exponentially-increasing one. This should help reduce slow metadata convergence after broker failure due to overload.KIP-963 Additional metrics in Tiered Storage:KIP-405 brought the early access of Tiered Storage, and with this update weâre introducing new metrics for the feature, allowing you to better monitor performance, troubleshoot, and prevent issues.KIP-979 Allow independently stop KRaft processes:Adds a way to independently stop KRaft processes in cases where operators are running in combined mode (a controller and broker in the same node). Previously, you could only stop both. The command line for stopping Kafka nodes now includes a pair of optional and mutually exclusive parameters "[--process-role]" OR "[--node-id]" to use with ./bin/kafka-server-stop.sh.KIP-890 Transactions Server-Side Defense:Another part of this KIP shipped, this time adding transaction verification preventing hanging transactions for consumer offset partitions.KIP-896 Remove old client protocol API versions in Kafka 4.0:KIP-896 marks all client request versions older than Apache Kafka 2.1 as deprecated, and introduces new metrics to monitor the presence of such requests. Support for these requests will be dropped in Apache Kafka 4.0.KIP-919 Allow AdminClient to Talk Directly with the KRaft Controller Quorum and add Controller Registration:Allows the AdminClient to talk directly with the KRaft Controller Quorum, which allows us to support operations like DESCRIBE_QUORUM and INCREMENTAL_ALTER_CONFIGS to dynamically change the log4j levels on a KRaft controller. This helps with debugging scenarios where other parts of the system are down.KIP-978 Allow dynamic reloading of certificates with different DN / SANs:Allows configurability to prevent checks that ensure DN (Distinguished Name) and SAN (Subject Alternative Names) are the same between old and new keystores when theyâre being reload. This ultimately allows dynamic reloading of certificates that have different DN/SANs.KIP-1001 Add CurrentControllerId Metric:Adds a CurrentControllerId metric, allowing users to find the current controller by looking at the metrics of any Kafka broker/controller.KIP-938 Add more metrics for measuring KRaft performance:Weâve added 11 new metrics for measuring KRaft-mode performance, including ActiveControllersCount, CurrentMetadataVersion and TimedOutBrokerHeartbeatCount.KIP-1013 Drop broker and tools support for Java 11 in Kafka 4.0 (deprecate in 3.7):Java 11 is now deprecated for all the server and tools modules - kafka-server-common, kafka-server, kafka_2.13, kafka-storage, kafka-metadata, kafka-group-coordinator, kafka-raft, kafka-shell, kafka-tools. It will not be supported after Kafka 4.0. All other modules (including clients, streams and connect) will continue to require Java 11 (as specified byKIP-750).Kafka StreamsKIP-925 Rack aware task assignment in Kafka Streams:In part one of KIP-925, the min_traffic assignment strategy for Kafka Streams was added. Part two finishes the KIP by introducing the second rack-aware assignment strategy: balanced_subtopology.KIP-954 Expand default DSL store configuration to custom types:KIP-954 builds on KIP-591 and allows users to provide a default state store provider for their custom stores. As part of this change, a new interface has been provided along with default support for RocksDB and in-memory state stores.KIP-962 Relax non-null key requirement in Kafka Streams:Kafka Streams treated records with null-keys as invalid input for joins and dropped them on the floor. KIP-962 relaxes this behavior for various left-joins and thus allows null-key records to be processed successfully.KIP-988 Streams Standby Update Listener:Adds a new interface for handling cases where standby tasks have their a) state stores registered, b) load a batch of records and c) stop updates.KIP-960/KIP-968IQ support for Versioned State Stores:Version state stores were added in Apache Kafka 3.5 release (KIP-889), but it was not possible so far to query the new stores. KIP-960 and KIP-968 close this gap by adding new query types for IQv2 namely VersionedKeyQuery and MultiVersionedKeyQuery, respectively. Both queries allow you to do lookups for a single key, to ask for the most recent value, a historic value, or a range of historic values for the provided key.KIP-985 Add reverseRange and reverseAll query over kv-store in IQv2:IQv2 supports RangeQueries which allow you to query for a range of keys. However, the API did not provide any guarantee about the ordering of the returned result. With KIP-985 itâs now possible to request the result to be ordered (per partition) in either ascending or descending order, or leave the order unspecified.KIP-992 Introduce IQv2 Query Types: TimestampedKeyQuery and TimestampedRangeQuery:Finally, KIP-992 adds new timestamped-key and timestamped-range interactive queries for timestamped key-value state stores. This change improves the type safety of the IQv2 API. The existing RangeQuery now always returns only the value if issued against a timestamped key-value store.Kafka ConnectKIP-976 Cluster-wide dynamic log adjustment for Kafka Connect:KIP-495 introduced the ability for users to dynamically change the log level of individual workers in their connect cluster. To address situations when it is not possible to target an individual worker, KIP-976 allows for dynamic log-level changes to be broadcast to all workers across the cluster in a single update.KIP-980 Allow creating connectors in a stopped state:This update allows users to create new Connectors in a STOPPED or PAUSED state, enabling use cases like migrating connectors. There is now a new optional "initial_state" field during connector creation.KIP-959 Add BooleanConverter to Kafka Connect:KIP-959 adds a BooleanConverter to Connect, supporting serializing and deserializing the boolean primitive in a Kafka Connect schema. This implements both org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.Converter and org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.HeaderConverter.KIP-970 Deprecate and remove Connect's redundant task configurations endpoint:Deprecates a redundant endpoint for fetching task configurations, eventually to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0.SummaryReady to get started with Apache Kafka 3.7.0?

This release contains many new features and improvements. This blog post will highlight some of the more prominent features. For a full list of changes, be sure to check therelease notes.See theUpgrading to 3.6.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.5.xsection in the documentation for the list of notable changes and detailed upgrade steps.The 3.6.0 release marked the first production ready release for the migration of Kafka
                    clusters from a ZooKeeper metadata system to a KRaft metadata system. Users wanting to
                    perform this migration are advised to first upgrade to 3.6.2 or 3.7.1 to receive important
                    bug fixes.See the ZooKeeper to KRaft migrationoperations documentationfor
                    details. Note that support for JBOD is still not available for KRaft clusters, therefore clusters
                    utilizing JBOD can not be migrated. SeeKIP-858for details regarding KRaft and JBOD.Support for Delegation Tokens in KRaft (KAFKA-15219) was completed in 3.6, further reducing the gap of features between ZooKeeper-based Kafka clusters and KRaft. Migration of delegation tokens from ZooKeeper to KRaft is also included in 3.6.Tiered Storageis an early access feature. It is currently only suitable for testing in non production environments. See theEarly Access Release Notesfor more details.Note: ZooKeeper is marked as deprecated since 3.5.0 release. ZooKeeper is planned to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. For more information, please see the documentation forZooKeeper DeprecationKafka Broker, Controller, Producer, Consumer and Admin ClientKIP-405:
                        Kafka Tiered Storage (Early Access):Introduces Tiered Storage to Kafka. Note that this
                        is an early access feature only advised for use in non-production environments (see theearly
                            access notesfor more information). This feature provides a separation of computation
                        and storage in the broker for pluggable storage tiering natively in Kafka Tiered Storage brings
                        a seamless extension of storage to remote objects with minimal operational changes.KIP-890:
                        Transactions Server Side Defense (Part 1):Hanging transactions can negatively impact
                        your read committed consumers and prevent compacted logs from being compacted. KIP-890 helps
                        address hanging transactions by verifying partition additions. Part 2 of KIP-890 will optimize
                        verification, which currently adds an extra hop.In 3.6.0, transaction verification will prevent hanging transactions on data partitions. In the next release, transactional offset commits will also be covered.KIP-797:
                        Accept duplicate listener on port for IPv4/IPv6:Until now, Kafka has not supported
                        duplicate listeners on the same port. This works when using only a single IP stack, but presents
                        an issue if you are working with both IPv4 and IPv6. With KIP-797, brokers can be configured
                        with listeners that have the same port on different IP stacks. This update does not affect
                        advertised listeners, which already have this feature.KIP-863:
                        Reduce CompletedFetch#parseRecord() memory copy:Reduces memory allocation and improves
                        memory performance during record deserialization by using a ByteBuffer instead of byte[] for
                        deserialization, which improves efficiency. Updated public interfaces include the Deserializer
                        class, ByteBufferDeserializer class, and StringDeserializer class.KIP-868:
                        Metadata Transactions:Improves the overall durability of the KRaft layer by adding
                        metadata transactions that consist of:BeginTransactionNumber of recordsEndTransaction or AbortTransactionKRaft uses record batches as a mechanism for atomicity. Typically, there was a limit to the
                        fetch size on the Raft consensus layer, and the controller could generate a set of atomic
                        records that exceeded this limit. This update introduces marker records that allow larger sets
                        of atomic records to be sent to the Raft consensus layer in multiple batches. This bypasses the
                        fetch limit.KIP-902:
                        Upgrade Zookeeper to 3.8.2:This upgrades the ZooKeeper version that is bundled with Kafka to
                        version 3.8.2. The new version includes several updates and security improvements.KIP-917:
                        Additional custom metadata for remote log segment:It introduces having an optional
                        custom metadata as part of remote log segment metadata. RemoteStorageManager returns the
                        optional custom metadata when copyLogSegmentData() is invoked. It will be passed along with
                        remote log segment metadata.KIP-937:
                        Improve Message Timestamp Validation:It improves data integrity and prevents potential
                        pitfalls caused by inaccurate timestamp handling by adding more validation logic for message
                        timestamps. While past timestamps are a normal occurrence in Kafka, future timestamps might
                        represent an incorrectly formatted integer. KIP-937 rejects messages with future timestamps and
                        provides a descriptive exemption.KIP-938:
                        Add more metrics for measuring KRaft performance:Adds new controller, loader, and snapshot emitter KRaft performance metrics.Kafka StreamsKIP-923: Add A Grace Period to Stream Table Join:Adds a grace period to stream-table joins to improve table-side out-of-order data handling. The joined object has a new method called "withGracePeriod" that will cause the table side lookup to only happen after the grace period has passed.KIP-941: Range queries to accept null lower and upper bounds:Previously, RangeQuery did not support null to specify âno upper/lower boundâ.
                    KIP-941 allows users to pass null into withRange(...) for lower/upper bounds to specify a full or half-open range:`withRange(null, null)` == `withNoBounds()``withRange(lower, null)` == `withLowerBound(lower)``withRange(null, upper)` == `withUpperBound(upper)`Kafka ConnectKIP-793: Allow sink connectors to be used with topic-mutating SMTs:Adds support for topic-mutating SMTs for async sink connectors. This is to address an incompatibility between sink connectors overriding the SinkTask::preCommit method and SMTs that mutate the topic field of a SinkRecord .KIP-875: First-class offsets support in Kafka Connect:Provides first-class admin support for offsets in Kafka Connect. KIP-875 Part 1 added endpoints to get offsets and a new STOPPED state for connectors. The alter offsets and reset offsets endpoints have now been added.ActionDescriptionGET /connectors/{connector}/offsetsRetrieve the offsets for a connector; the connector must existPATCH /connectors/{connector}/offsetsAlter the offsets for a connector; the connector must exist, and must be in the STOPPED stateDELETE /connectors/{connector}/offsetsReset the offsets for a connector; the connector must exist, and must be in the STOPPED statePUT /connectors/{connector}/pausePause the connector; the connector must existKIP-898: Modernize Connect plugin discovery:With KIP-898, Connect workers can now read from ServiceLoader manifests and module info directly during startup for more efficient plugin class discovery. Note that this update allows connector developers to add service declarations to their plugins.SummaryReady to get started with Apache Kafka 3.6.0?
