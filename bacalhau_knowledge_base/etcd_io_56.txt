endpointRegistering an endpoint with a leaseAtomically updating endpointsVersionsv3.6-DRAFTDeveloper guidegRPC naming and discoverygRPC naming and discoverygo-grpc: for resolving gRPC endpoints with an etcd backendetcd provides a gRPC resolver to support an alternative name system that fetches endpoints from etcd for discovering gRPC services. The underlying mechanism is based on watching updates to keys prefixed with the service name.Using etcd discovery with go-grpcThe etcd client provides a gRPC resolver for resolving gRPC endpoints with an etcd backend. The resolver is initialized with an etcd client:import(clientv3"go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3"etcdnaming"go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3/naming/resolver""google.golang.org/grpc")...cli,err:=clientv3.NewFromURL("http://localhost:2379")iferr!=nil{// ...}r,err:=etcdnaming.NewBuilder(cli)iferr!=nil{// ...}conn,gerr:=grpc.Dial("my-service",grpc.WithResolvers(r),grpc.WithBlock(),...)Managing service endpointsThe etcd resolver treats all keys under the prefix of the resolution target following a “/” (e.g., “foo/bar/my-service/”)
with JSON-encoded (historically go-grpcnaming.Update) values as potential service endpoints.
Endpoints are added to the service by creating new keys and removed from the service by deleting keys.Adding an endpointNew endpoints can be added to the service throughetcdctl:ETCDCTL_API=3etcdctl put foo/bar/my-service/1.2.3.4'{"Addr":"1.2.3.4","Metadata":"..."}'The etcd client’sendpoints.Managermethod can also register new endpoints with a key matching theAddr:em:=endpoints.NewManager(client,"foo/bar/my-service")err:=em.AddEndpoint(context.TODO(),"foo/bar/my-service/e1",endpoints.Endpoint{Addr:"1.2.3.4"})To enable round-robin load balancing when dialing service with multiple endpoints, you can set up you connection with grpc
internal round-robin load balancer:conn,gerr:=grpc.Dial("etcd:///foo",grpc.WithResolvers(etcdResolver),grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(`{"loadBalancingPolicy":"round_robin"}`))Deleting an endpointHosts can be deleted from the service throughetcdctl:ETCDCTL_API=3etcdctl del foo/bar/my-service/1.2.3.4The etcd client’sendpoints.Managermethod also supports deleting endpoints:em:=endpoints.NewManager(client,"foo/bar/my-service")err:=em.DeleteEndpoint(context.TODO(),"foo/bar/my-service/e1")Registering an endpoint with a leaseRegistering an endpoint with a lease ensures that if the host can’t maintain a keepalive heartbeat (e.g., its machine fails), it will be removed from the service:lease=`ETCDCTL_API=3etcdctl lease grant5|cut -f2 -d' '`ETCDCTL_API=3etcdctl put --lease=$leasemy-service/1.2.3.4'{"Addr":"1.2.3.4","Metadata":"..."}'ETCDCTL_API=3etcdctl lease keep-alive$leaseIn the golang:em:=endpoints.NewManager(client,"foo/bar/my-service")err:=em.AddEndpoint(context.TODO(),"foo/bar/my-service/e1",endpoints.Endpoint{Addr:"1.2.3.4"})Atomically updating endpointsIf it’s desired to modify multiple endpoints in a single transaction,endpoints.Managercan be used directly:em := endpoints.NewManager(c, "foo")

err := em.Update(context.TODO(), []*endpoints.UpdateWithOpts{
    endpoints.NewDeleteUpdateOpts("foo/bar/my-service/e1", endpoints.Endpoint{Addr: "1.2.3.4"}),
	endpoints.NewAddUpdateOpts("foo/bar/my-service/e1", endpoints.Endpoint{Addr: "1.2.3.14"})})FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it! Pleasetell us how we can improve.Sorry to hear that.
