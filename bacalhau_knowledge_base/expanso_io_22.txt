By 2025, it is projected that there will be 5x more data generated.
Over 57% of today’s data is already generated outside of traditional data centers. Identifying valuable information within this vast dataset is crucial for analyzing your business.

Data Challenges
Minimal Infrastructure, Maximum Protection
Building a comprehensive data infrastructure often means adding new hardware, whether for edge, cloud, or on-premise computing. While security and reliability are crucial, they can significantly increase costs.
Distributed Computing Solution
At Expanso, we focus on optimizing existing resources to deliver secure, reliable, and cost-effective solutions. Instead of the heavy hardware investments typical of traditional solutions, our software leans on minimal infrastructure, integrating with your existing devices and equipment. This not only saves costs but also enhances data security, layering additional protection without stretching your resources.
Data Governance
Growing data regulations and security demands make building a robust infrastructure challenging, increasing time and costs while risking security and legal issues.
solution
Expanso simplifies data governance with an architecture that streamlines management and control of data flows without losing functionality. Our platform ensures you maintain full control and compliance with your governance policies, and by minimizing data transfers, we reduce the risks associated with data movement.
Data Sovereignty
Moving to the cloud isn’t always an option, especially when dealing with strict data regulations and security concerns. This can make the use and orchestration of edge computing extremely difficult.
solution
Expanso gives you the flexibility of a global cloud platform while keeping your data safe on-premise. By deploying jobs and ML models directly to where data originates and resides, it remains securely within your environment. Our ‘Compute Over Data’ approach means you get the best of both worlds: flexibility without sacrificing security.
