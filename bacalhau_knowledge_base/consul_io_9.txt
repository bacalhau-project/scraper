This is especially true with microservices. Since applications are composed of many interdependent services, there's a need to have a topological view of the services and their dependencies. Furthermore, there is a desire to have insight into health and performance metrics for the different services.SolutionCentralized visualizationConsul collects metrics and provides a built-in UI to help visualize topology between interdependent services. This can be helpful when configuring new services or troubleshooting existing connections. Consul service mesh on Kubernetes provides a deep integration with Prometheus, including a starter experience for installing Prometheus in demo or dev environments. Consul can also expose metrics from the Envoy proxies onto Prometheus and Granfana to provide visualization for layer 7 application traffic. Deeper observability is also available with third-party tools like DataDog.Customer case studyHow Comcast runs Consul service mesh on Amazon ECSLearn how Comcast is using Consul as its service mesh solution for Amazon ECS.Read moreTutorialsExplore allTutorialVisualize service mesh communication in the Consul UIView the service mesh topology diagram for two example services.
