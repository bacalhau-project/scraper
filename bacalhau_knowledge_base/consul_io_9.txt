Tutorial
Manage traffic with Consul service mesh
You will be introduced to Consul service mesh's comprehensive traffic management features.
Use case
Consul offers the ability to manage L4/L7 traffic based on service identity and implement progressive delivery practices like canary deployments or A/B testing.
Challenge
There are many scenarios where developers would want to customize traffic flow between services. For example, developers want to deploy new versions of a service in a controlled manner without causing downtime. Bluntly taking old versions down and deploying new versions leads to downtime and can risk exposure to extended outages if unexpected problems emerge.
Solution
Consul solves for these use cases including canary testing, A/B tests, blue/green deployment, and soft multi-tenancy (prod/qa/staging sharing compute resources). Developers can shape traffic between services in a methodical manner when introducing a new version of their service. They can gradually direct traffic to the new version and increase the traffic percentage over time, thereby reducing the risks associated with application updates.
