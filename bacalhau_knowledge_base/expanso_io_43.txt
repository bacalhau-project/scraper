OVERVIEW
Bacalhau, the [open-source](https://opensource.org/) platform that powers Expanso, stands as a testament to our unwavering commitment to open-source innovation. Designed to redefine the way we approach fast, cost-effective and secure computation, Bacalhau is rooted in community-driven advancements. Centered on executing tasks precisely where data is generated and stored, Bacalhau integrates seamlessly with existing Docker and WebAssembly (WASM) workflows. This strategy, called Compute Over Data (CoD), is set to revolutionize large-scale dataset processing.
Problems enterprises face today.
Large-scale data challenges:
VOLUME
Individual devices generating or storing over 100GB might seem manageable. But when you scale this up to 10, 100, or even thousands of devices, the data volume can quickly reach terabytes or petabytes. This sheer volume can be challenging for traditional storage and processing systems to handle.
VELOCITY
Devices, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, can generate data at an incredibly fast rate. This rapid data generation can strain the ingestion capabilities of traditional systems.
VARIETY
Data from different devices can come in various formats. Some might produce structured data, while others might produce unstructured or semi-structured data. Managing this variety can be complex.
VERACITY
With the increase in the number of devices, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of data becomes a challenge.
Implications
BOTTLENECKS
INCREASED COSTS
SECURITY CONCERNS
DATA LOSS
How Bacalhau solves those challenges:
Distributed Computing Solution
Bacalhau offers a solution for these data-intensive problems by using distributed computing. Managing data close to where itâ€™s generated or stored enhances processing speed, agility and security. Find out more in our [documentation](https://docs.bacalhau.org/).
