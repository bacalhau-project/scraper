Documentation
Device plugins
Nomad’s support for device plugins allows it to take advantage of hardware running on specialized devices.
Use case
Deploy, manage, and scale workloads efficiently at the edge.
Challenge
There are an increasing number of use cases across industries for distributing location-sensitive applications outside of centralized cloud datacenters and running them closer to where they are needed. Each of these applications has unique performance requirements and runs on various processors, operating systems, and device types. It becomes difficult to manage geographically distributed edge environments with automated and operationally efficient workflows.
Solution
With Nomad, you can build a single, consolidated workflow that gives you the flexibility and control that is necessary to fit the unique requirements of each application at the edge. Nomad’s support for device plugins allows it to take advantage of hardware running on specialized devices and you can deploy Nomad with a single-cluster topology on hybrid infrastructure to place workloads to the cloud or at the edge.
