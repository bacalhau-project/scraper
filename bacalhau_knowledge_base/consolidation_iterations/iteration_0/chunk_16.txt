Basics tutorial
A basic tutorial introduction to gRPC in Python.
Basics tutorial
This tutorial provides a basic Python programmer’s introduction to working with gRPC.
By walking through this example you’ll learn how to:
- Define a service in a
.proto
file. - Generate server and client code using the protocol buffer compiler.
- Use the Python gRPC API to write a simple client and server for your service.
It assumes that you have read the [Introduction to gRPC](/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) and are familiar
with [protocol
buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview). You can
find out more in the [proto3 language
guide](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3) and [Python
generated code
guide](https://protobuf.dev/reference/python/python-generated).
Why use gRPC?
Our example is a simple route mapping application that lets clients get information about features on their route, create a summary of their route, and exchange route information such as traffic updates with the server and other clients.
With gRPC we can define our service once in a.proto
file and generate clients
and servers in any of gRPC’s supported languages, which in turn can be run in
environments ranging from servers inside a large data center to your own tablet —
all the complexity of communication between different languages and environments is
handled for you by gRPC. We also get all the advantages of working with protocol
buffers, including efficient serialization, a simple IDL, and easy interface
updating.
Example code and setup
The example code for this tutorial is in
[grpc/grpc/examples/python/route_guide](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/v1.66.0/examples/python/route_guide).
To download the example, clone the grpc
repository by running the following
command:
$ git clone -b v1.66.0 --depth 1 --shallow-submodules https://github.com/grpc/grpc
Then change your current directory to examples/python/route_guide
in the repository:
$ cd grpc/examples/python/route_guide
You also should have the relevant tools installed to generate the server and
client interface code - if you don’t already, follow the setup instructions in
[Quick start](../quickstart/).
Defining the service
Your first step (as you’ll know from the [Introduction to gRPC](/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/)) is to
define the gRPC service and the method request and response types using
[protocol
buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview). You can
see the complete.proto
file in
[ examples/protos/route_guide.proto](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.66.0/examples/protos/route_guide.proto).
To define a service, you specify a named service
in your.proto
file:
service RouteGuide {
// (Method definitions not shown)
}
Then you define rpc
methods inside your service definition, specifying their
request and response types. gRPC lets you define four kinds of service method,
all of which are used in the RouteGuide
service:
A simple RPC where the client sends a request to the server using the stub and waits for a response to come back, just like a normal function call.
// Obtains the feature at a given position. rpc GetFeature(Point) returns (Feature) {}
A response-streaming RPC where the client sends a request to the server and gets a stream to read a sequence of messages back. The client reads from the returned stream until there are no more messages. As you can see in the example, you specify a response-streaming method by placing the
stream
keyword before the response type.//
