Benchmarking Using NATS CLI Tool
Jean-Noël Moyne — December 28, 2021
Benchmarks for throughput and speed have always been a desired data point for choosing messaging infrastructures but can be controversial due to the varying circumstances of the hardware, environment, and software version in use.
Published benchmarks are often deemed not credible as the results can be skewed to improve performance and therefore become unreliable for critical infrastructure decision making. With this in mind, we always recommend performing benchmarks using an environment as close to your production use as possible.
This tutorial video shows you how you can easily use the NATS CLI tool to test and benchmark Core NATS and JetStream NATS functionality in order to generate your own set of benchmark numbers using your own target environment.
