System requirements
The etcd performance benchmarks run etcd on 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 50GB SSD GCE
instances, but any relatively modern machine with low latency storage and a few
gigabytes of memory should suffice for most use cases. Applications with large
v2 data stores will require more memory than a large v3 data store since data is
kept in anonymous memory instead of memory mapped from a file. For running etcd
on a cloud provider, see the [Example hardware
configuration](../op-guide/hardware#example-hardware-configurations) documentation.
Download the pre-built binary
The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries
which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, appc, and Docker. Instructions for
using these binaries are on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/).
Build the latest version
For those wanting to try the very latest version, build etcd from the master
branch. [Go](https://golang.org/) version 1.9+ is required to build the latest
version of etcd. To ensure etcd is built against well-tested libraries, etcd
vendors its dependencies for official release binaries. However, etcd’s
vendoring is also optional to avoid potential import conflicts when embedding
the etcd server or using the etcd client.
To build etcd
from the master
branch without a GOPATH
using the official
build
script:
$ git clone https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd.git
$ cd etcd
$ ./build
To build a vendored etcd
from the master
branch via go get
:
# GOPATH should be set
$ echo $GOPATH
/Users/example/go
$ go get -v go.etcd.io/etcd
$ go get -v go.etcd.io/etcd/etcdctl
Test the installation
Check the etcd binary is built correctly by starting etcd and setting a key.
Starting etcd
If etcd is built without using go get
, run the following:
$ ./bin/etcd
If etcd is built using go get
, run the following:
$ $GOPATH/bin/etcd
Setting a key
Run the following:
$ ./bin/etcdctl put foo bar
OK
(or $GOPATH/bin/etcdctl put foo bar
if etcdctl was installed with go get
)
If OK is printed, then etcd is working!
