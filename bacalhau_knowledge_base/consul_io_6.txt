However, legacy systems and old practices cannot keep up with the rate of change of modern applications. If an event occurs that auto-scales additional service instances, networking and security teams are oftentimes still dealing with manual ticket-driven processes that can slow down solution delivery and introduce a higher likelihood of misconfiguration.SolutionNetwork infrastructure automation with ConsulAdopting network infrastructure automation (NIA) with Consul-Terraform-Sync ensures networking and security infrastructure safely adapts to changes. Consul-Terraform-Sync automates various networking tasks and workflows based on changes observed by Consul. The tasks can be triggered by different events, like the scaling of service instances, change of service address or port number, and updates to service tags, meta, or health. This leads to improved delivery times and greatly reduces the chances of misconfigurations.Customer case studyAchieving network infrastructure automation with HashiCorp Consul at WorkdayLearn how Workday uses Consul-Terraform-Sync to accomplish traditional networking tasks faster.Read moreTutorialsExplore allTutorialNetwork infrastructure automation with Consul-Terraform-SyncIn this tutorial you will learn how to install Consul-Terraform-Sync and configure it to communicate and react to your Consul datacenter.TutorialConsul-Terraform-Sync run modes and status inspectionLearn the different run modes available with Consul-Terraform-Sync, how to monitor the task status, and how to locate the Terraform state files.TutorialConsul-Terraform-Sync and integrationIn this tutorial you will learn how to configure Consul-Terraform-Sync to interact with Terraform Enterprise and HCP Terraform.DocsExplore allDocumentationNetwork infrastructure automationNetwork infrastructure automation (NIA) enables dynamic updates to network infrastructure devices triggered by service changes.DocumentationConsul-Terraform-Sync ArchitectureConsul-Terraform-Sync runs as a daemon and integrates the network topology to dynamically secure and connect services.DocumentationInstall Consul-Terraform-SyncLearn how to download and install Consul-Terraform-Sync.Get started with HCP ConsulWe’ve built a series of step-by-step guides to help you deploy HCP Consul and try it for yourself.Try HCP Consul for freePlay videoNetwork infrastructure automation (NIA)In this whiteboard video, HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar shows why it's crucial — in the cloud adoption era — to use infrastructure as code not only for automating and templatizing your system's required compute and database resources, but also its networking infrastructure, such as firewalls, load balancers, routers, etc.IntroGuidesDocsCommunityPrivacySecurityConsent ManagerManage cookiesHashiCorp uses data collected by cookies and JavaScript libraries to improve your browsing experience, analyze site traffic, and increase the overall performance of our site.
