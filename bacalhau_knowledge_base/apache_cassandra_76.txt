Cassandra schema and build queries.Hackoladeis a data
modeling tool that supports schema design for Cassandra and many other
NoSQL databases. Hackolade supports the unique concepts of CQL such as
partition keys and clustering columns, as well as data types including
collections and UDTs. It also provides the ability to create Chebotko
diagrams.Kashlev Data Modeleris a Cassandra data
modeling tool that automates the data modeling methodology described in
this documentation, including identifying access patterns, conceptual,
logical, and physical data modeling, and schema generation. It also
includes model patterns that you can optionally leverage as a starting
point for your designs.DataStax DevCenter is a tool for managing schema, executing queries
and viewing results. While the tool is no longer actively supported, it
is still popular with many developers and is available as afree download. DevCenter
features syntax highlighting for CQL commands, types, and name literals.
DevCenter provides command completion as you type out CQL commands and
interprets the commands you type, highlighting any errors you make. The
tool provides panes for managing multiple CQL scripts and connections to
multiple clusters. The connections are used to run CQL commands against
live clusters and view the results. The tool also has a query trace
feature that is useful for gaining insight into the performance of your
queries.IDE Plugins - There are CQL plugins available for several Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs), such as IntelliJ IDEA and Apache
NetBeans. These plugins typically provide features such as schema
management and query execution.Some IDEs and tools that claim to support Cassandra do not actually
support CQL natively, but instead access Cassandra using a JDBC/ODBC
driver and interact with Cassandra as if it were a relational database
with SQL support. When selecting tools for working with Cassandra youâll
want to make sure they support CQL and reinforce Cassandra best
practices for data modeling as presented in this documentation.Material adapted from Cassandra, The Definitive Guide. Published by
