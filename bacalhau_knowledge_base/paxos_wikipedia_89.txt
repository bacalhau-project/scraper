Lamport(born February 7, 1941) is an Americancomputer scientistandmathematician. Lamport is best known for his seminal work indistributed systems, and as the initial developer of the document preparation systemLaTeXand the author of its first manual.[2]Lamport was the winner of the 2013Turing Award[3]for imposing clear, well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior ofdistributed computingsystems, in which several autonomous computers communicate with each other by passing messages. He devised importantalgorithmsand developedformal modelingand verification protocols that improve the quality of real distributed systems. These contributions have resulted in improved correctness, performance, and reliability of computer systems.[4][5][6][7][8]Early life and education[edit]Lamport was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Benjamin and Hannah Lamport (née Lasser).[citation needed]His father was an immigrant from Volkovisk in theRussian Empire(nowVawkavysk,Belarus)[9]and his mother was an immigrant from theAustro-Hungarian Empire, now southeastern Poland.A graduate ofBronx High School of Science, Lamport received aB.S.inmathematicsfrom theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyin 1960, followed byM.A.(1963) andPh.D.(1972) degrees in mathematics fromBrandeis University.[10]His dissertation,The analytic Cauchy problem with singular data, is about singularities in analyticpartial differential equations.[11]Career and research[edit]Lamport worked as a computer scientist atMassachusetts Computer Associatesfrom 1970 to 1977, Stanford Research Institute (SRI International) from 1977 to 1985, andDigital Equipment CorporationandCompaqfrom 1985 to 2001. In 2001 he joinedMicrosoft ResearchinCalifornia.[10]Distributed systems[edit]Lamport's research contributions have laid the foundations of the theory of distributed systems. Among his most notable papers are"Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System",[5]which received thePrinciples of Distributed Computing (PODC) Influential Paper Awardin 2000,[12]"How to Make a Multiprocessor Computer That Correctly Executes Multiprocess Programs",[13]which defined the notion ofsequential consistency,"The Byzantine Generals' Problem",[14]"Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of a Distributed System"[15]and"The Part-Time Parliament".[16]These papers relate to such concepts aslogical clocks(and thehappened-beforerelationship) andByzantine failures. They are among the most cited papers in the field of computer science,[17]and describe algorithms to solve many fundamental problems in distributed systems, including:thePaxos algorithmforconsensus,thebakery algorithmformutual exclusionof multiple threads in a computer system that require the same resources at the same time,theChandy–Lamport algorithmfor the determination of consistent global states (snapshot), andtheLamport signature, one of the prototypes of the digital signature.LaTeX[edit]WhenDonald Knuthbegan issuing the early releases ofTeXin the early 1980s, Lamport — due to his personal need of writing a book — also began working on a set of macros based on it, hoping that it would later become its standard macro package. This set of macros would later become known asLaTeX, for which Lamport would subsequently be approached in 1983 by Peter Gordon, anAddison-Wesleyeditor, who proposed that Lamport turn its user manual into a book.[18][19]In September 1984, Lamport released version 2.06a of the LaTeX macros, and in August 1985, LaTeX 2.09 — the last version of Lamport's LaTeX — would be released as well. Meanwhile, Addison-Wesley released Lamport's first LaTeX user manual,LaTeX: A Document Preparation System, in 1986, which purportedly sold "more than a few hundred thousands" copies, and on August 21, 1989, at a TeX User Group meeting atStanford, Lamport would agree to turn over the maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach, who, along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Schöpf, would form the LaTeX3 team, subsequently releasing LaTeX 2e, the current version of LaTeX, in 1994.[19][20]Temporal logic[edit]Lamport is also known for his work ontemporal logic, where he introduced thetemporal logic of actions(TLA).[21][22]Among his more recent contributions isTLA+, a language for specifying and reasoning about concurrent and reactive systems, which he describes in the bookSpecifying Systems: The TLA+Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers.[23]He defines TLA+ as a "quixoticattempt to overcome engineers' antipathy towards mathematics".[24]Awards and honors[edit]Lamport received the 2013Turing Awardfor "fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of distributed and concurrent systems, notably the invention of concepts such as causality and logical clocks, safety and liveness, replicated state machines, and sequential consistency" in 2014.[25]He was elected a member of theNational Academy of Engineeringin 1991 for contributions to the theoretical foundations of concurrent and fault-tolerant computing. He was elected to Fellow ofAssociation for Computing Machineryfor fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of distributed and concurrent systems in 2014.[26]He also received five honorary doctorates from European universities:University of RennesandChristian Albrechts University of Kielin 2003,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)in 2004,University of Luganoin 2006, andNancy-Universitéin 2007.[10]In 2004, he received theIEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award.[27]In 2005, the paper "Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults"[28]received theDijkstra Prize.[29]In honor of Lamport's sixtieth birthday, a lecture series was organized at the 20thSymposium on Principles of Distributed Computing(PODC 2001).[30]In 2008, he received theIEEE John von Neumann Medal.[31]In 2011, he was elected to theNational Academy of Sciences.[32]References[edit]^Leslie Lamportat theMathematics Genealogy Project^Lamport, Leslie (1986).LaTeX: A Document Preparation System.
