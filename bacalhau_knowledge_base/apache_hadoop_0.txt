It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.Learn more »Download »Getting started »Latest newsRelease 3.4.0 available2024 Mar 17This is the first release of Apache Hadoop 3.4 line. It contains 2888 bug fixes, improvements and enhancements since 3.3.Users are encouraged to read theoverview of major changes.
For details of please checkrelease notesandchangelog.Release 3.3.6 available2023 Jun 23This is a release of Apache Hadoop 3.3 line.It contains 117 bug fixes, improvements and enhancements since 3.3.5.
Users of Apache Hadoop 3.3.5 and earlier should upgrade to this release.Feature highlights:SBOM artifactsStarting from this release, Hadoop publishes Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using
CycloneDX Maven plugin. For more information on SBOM, please go toSBOM.HDFS RBF: RDBMS based token storage supportHDFS Router-Router Based Federation now supports storing delegation tokens on MySQL,HADOOP-18535which improves token operation through over the original Zookeeper-based implementation.New File System APIsHADOOP-18671moved a number of
HDFS-specific APIs to Hadoop Common to make it possible for certain applications that
depend on HDFS semantics to run on other Hadoop compatible file systems.In particular, recoverLease() and isFileClosed() are exposed through LeaseRecoverable
interface, while setSafeMode() is exposed through SafeMode interface.Users are encouraged to read theoverview of major changessince release 3.3.5.

transitive CVEs under control -both genuine and false positives.Critical fix to ABFS input stream prefetching for correct reading.Vectored IO API for all FSDataInputStream implementations, with
high-performance versions for file:// and s3a:// filesystems.
file:// through java native IO
s3a:// parallel GET requests.Arm64 binaries. Note, because the arm64 release was on a different
platform, the jar files may not match those of the x86
release -and therefore the maven artifacts.Security fixes in Hadoop’s own code.Users of Apache Hadoop 3.3.4 and earlier should upgrade to

managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters which includes
support for Hadoop HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, HCatalog, HBase,
ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides a dashboard
for viewing cluster health such as heatmaps and ability to view
MapReduce, Pig and Hive applications visually alongwith features to
diagnose their performance characteristics in a user-friendly
manner.Avroâ¢: A data serialization system.Cassandraâ¢: A scalable multi-master database
with no single points of failure.Chukwaâ¢: A data collection system for managing

distributed cluster.Tezâ¢: A generalized data-flow programming framework,
built on Hadoop YARN, which provides a powerful and flexible engine
to execute an arbitrary DAG of tasks to process data for both batch
and interactive use-cases. Tez is being adopted by Hiveâ¢, Pigâ¢ and
other frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem, and also by other
commercial software (e.g. ETL tools), to replace Hadoopâ¢ MapReduce
as the underlying execution engine.ZooKeeperâ¢: A high-performance coordination
