Consul can be your single source of truth for cataloging and maintaining a record of all your services.ChallengeMaintaining service informationTraditionally, applications and services tend to be static where IPs remain unchanged. Maintaining service information like IP addresses was manageable with configuration management databases (CMDB). However, this becomes a challenge today where cloud-based applications are much more dynamic and traditional tools struggle to keep up. This is even more evident today with microservices that are ephemeral and constantly changing.SolutionUse Consul to discover, track, and monitor servicesRather than depending on legacy tools that require manual updates, developers can use Consul to discover, track, and monitor services. Clients can then query Consul's API and discover service dependencies.Customer case studyMercedes-BenzCars, Kubernetes, and HashiCorp Consul.
