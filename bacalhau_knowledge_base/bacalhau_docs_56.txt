Running a Prolog Script
Introduction
Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations. Prolog is well-suited for specific tasks that benefit from rule-based logical queries such as searching databases, voice control systems, and filling templates.
This tutorial is a quick guide on how to run a hello world script on Bacalhau.
Prerequisites
To get started, you need to install the Bacalhau client, see more information [here](/getting-started/installation)
1. Running Locally
To get started, install swipl
Create a file called helloworld.pl
. The following script prints ‘Hello World’ to the stdout:
Running the script to print out the output:
After the script has run successfully locally, we can now run it on Bacalhau.
Before running it on Bacalhau we need to upload it to IPFS.
Using the IPFS cli
:
Run the command below to check if our script has been uploaded.
This command outputs the CID. Copy the CID of the file, which in our case is QmYq9ipYf3vsj7iLv5C67BXZcpLHxZbvFAJbtj7aKN5qii
Since the data uploaded to IPFS isn’t pinned, we will need to do that manually. Check this information on how to pin your [data](/setting-up/data-ingestion/pin) We recommend using [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/).
2. Running a Bacalhau Job
We will mount the script to the container using the -i
flag: -i: ipfs://< CID >:/< name-of-the-script >
.
To submit a job, run the following Bacalhau command:
Structure of the Command
-i ipfs://QmYq9ipYf3vsj7iLv5C67BXZcpLHxZbvFAJbtj7aKN5qii:/helloworld.pl
: Sets the input data for the container.mYq9ipYf3vsj7iLv5C67BXZcpLHxZbvFAJbtj7aKN5qii
is our CID which points to thehelloworld.pl
file on the IPFS network. This file will be accessible within the container.-- swipl -q -s helloworld.pl -g hello_world
: instructs SWI-Prolog to load the program from thehelloworld.pl
file and execute thehello_world
function in quiet mode:-q
: running in quiet mode-s
: load file as a script. In this case we want to run thehelloworld.pl
script-g
: is the name of the function you want to execute. In this case itshello_world
When a job is submitted, Bacalhau prints out the related job_id
. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on:
3. Checking the State of your Jobs
Job status: You can check the status of the job using bacalhau job list
.
When it says Published
or Completed
, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.
Job information: You can find out more information about your job by using bacalhau job describe
.
Job download: You can download your job results directly by using bacalhau job get
. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory (results
) and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.
4. Viewing your Job Output
To view the file, run the following command:
