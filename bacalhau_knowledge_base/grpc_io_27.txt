C# / .NET
This page used to contain the documentation for the original C# implementation
of gRPC based on the native gRPC Core library (i.e. Grpc.Core
nuget package).
The implementation is currently in maintenance mode and its source code has
been [moved](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/csharp/README.md). We plan to deprecate
the implementation in the future (see [blogpost](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-csharp-future/)) and we recommend that
all users use the [grpc-dotnet](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet) implementation instead.
The following pages cover the C# implementation of gRPC for .NET
([grpc-dotnet](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet)):
Several sample applications are available from the [examples](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/tree/master/examples) folder in the
[grpc-dotnet](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet) repository.
