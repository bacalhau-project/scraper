Thank you for helping safeguard our trademarks and brand elements.
Expanso deeply appreciates the trust that people put in our products, services, and experiences. These Trademark Guidelines (“Trademark Guidelines”) outline the ways you can help us protect Expanso’s brand assets, including logos, names, icons, and the trust that they represent. We have designed these guidelines to clarify proper usage of our brand assets. Expanso maintains the right to act as required to protect them and, as a result, protect its customers and the public.
Expanso’s brand assets— such as the logos, icons, trade dress, and the names of Expanso software, products, and services, and any other brand features and elements, whether they are registered or not, are proprietary assets owned exclusively by Expanso. These Trademark Guidelines explain how our brand assets can be used under specific circumstances. Unless you have an express license from Expanso, these Trademark Guidelines will exclusively govern your use of our brand assets. Several uses, including use of our logos, app and product icons, and other designs, are not covered by these Trademark Guidelines and will require a license.
Our commitment to open source principles.
While our software is available under a free and open source software license, the copyright license does not include any right, express or implied, to use our trademarks. These guidelines are where we describe how you may use our trademarks.
We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our software by the community, but do so in a way that still ensures that the trademarks are meaningful as a source and quality indicator for the software and the associated goods and services. The role of trademarks is different from copyright. Trademarks provide assurance about the quality of the products or services the trademark is used with. But because an open source license allows your unrestricted modification of the copyrighted software, we cannot be sure that your modifications to the software are ones that will not mislead users about the qualities of the product they are getting from you. Instead, this Policy describes the circumstances under which you may use our brand assets to accurately describe your products and your relationship with Expanso.
This Policy therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to ensure that our trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to preserve and 2) your ability to fully exercise the rights granted in the open source license.
In this Policy, we are not trying to limit the lawful use of our trademarks, but rather describe for you what we consider the parameters of lawful use to be. Trademark law can be ambiguous, so we hope to provide enough clarity for you to understand whether we will consider your use non-infringing.
The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this Policy, as well as uses of the trademarks that are allowed without additional permission from us. If you want to use our trademarks in ways that are not described in this Policy, please see “Where To Get Further Information” below for contact information. Any use that does not comply with this Policy or for which we have not separately provided written permission is not a use that we have approved, so you must decide for yourself whether the use is nevertheless lawful.
Trademarks covered by this policy.
This Policy encompasses:
The following word trademarks and service marks (the “Marks”):
Expanso™ - “company,” “products,” “services,” “solution”
Bacalhau™ - “project,” “platform,” “software,” “community”

Overarching principles for all uses.
Whenever you use our brand assets, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement in two major ways described in more detail at the end: it prohibits creating a “likelihood of confusion” but allows for “nominative use.”
This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.
Dos.
In general, you may do the following with the Marks:
You can distribute unaltered source code or binaries we compiled and label them with the Marks. You can modify, build and test the software without having to remove any Marks or other brand assets when the use is for your internal developmental, testing, and integration purposes. However, if you alter the source code and redistribute it, or build your own binary from source, you will have to remove any trademark image files and give your product a new, non-confusing, name.
If your product, service, or solution works with, is compatible with, or integrates with an Expanso product (including Bacalhau), service, or solution, you can describe that compatibility or integration. You should use your own trademark first, followed by a preposition that describes its relationship to our products or services, such as “compatible with Expanso/Bacalhau” or “add-in for Expanso/Bacalhau.”
You can use the Marks in text to refer to Expanso and its products and services (including Bacalhau). When using the trademarks in text, please follow the trademark with the category names that are listed above for them, for example, “Bacalhau™ software” or “Expanso™ services.”
You may use our Marks to refer to our products and services in your publication, seminars, or conferences, but not in a way that might suggest that you are the one providing them. For example, you can have a conference track titled “Getting the Most out of the Bacalhau Platform” but not a conference titled “Bacalhau Conference.”
You can use the Marks Use in article headlines or titles, as long as the use is referential and not misleading.
You should accompany the first or most visible mention of a Mark with the trademark symbol shown above.
Wherever you provide similar information for your own trademarks, please include this trademark legend for our trademarks: “Bacalhau, (followed by other trademarks in alphabetical order) is a trademark of Expanso Inc.”

General Information about trademarks and their use.
What is a trademark?
A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. “Trade dress” or “get up” refers to the look and feel of the packaging, which in this context can include the layout, colors, images, and design choices in a web page. Throughout this Policy, the terms “trademark” and “mark” refer to both trademarks, service marks and trade dress.
However, the use of a word is “not as a trademark” when it is used functionally as part of the software program, for example, in a file, folder, directory, or path name. Use in this way is not a trademark infringement.
What is "likelihood of confusion"?
There is trademark infringement if your use of a trademark has created a “likelihood of confusion.” This means using a trademark in a way that will likely confuse or deceive the relevant consuming public about the source of a product or service using the mark in question. For example, if the “Foo” software extension removes all double spaces after periods, but someone else later creates “Foo” software that adds a third space after periods, consumers would be confused between the two and the newcomer will likely be a trademark infringer. As another example, if a company makes “Foobar” software and a third party offers training called “Foobar Certification,” a person is likely to believe, wrongly, that the certification is being offered by the makers of Foobar software. The third party has likely misled consumers about the source of its training and is a trademark infringer.
What is "nominative" use?
“Nominative use,” “referential use,” or “nominative fair use,” (which is the name of the doctrine under U.S. trademark law), allows the use of another’s trademark where it is necessary for understanding. Other countries’ trademark laws also have similar provisions. For example, a car repair shop that specializes in a particular brand of automobile, VW for example, must be allowed to say that they repair VW cars. Here is what you should consider when deciding whether your use of a trademark is a nominative fair use:
Whether you can identify the product or service in question without using thetrademark;
Whether you are avoiding a likelihood of confusion in the way that you have used the trademark; and
Whether you have used only as much as is necessary to identify the product or service.
