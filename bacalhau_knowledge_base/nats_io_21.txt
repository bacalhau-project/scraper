This telemetry data is transmitted over UHF radio waves to the NASCAR mobile data center (literally a data center in a semi-truck trailer that goes to each track venue), where it is then ingested and retransmitted both to the racing teams and broadcasters on-site at the track but also to the AWS cloud where it is both stored for historical analysis and re-distributed in real-time to the team‚Äôs back offices and to racing fans.Why NATSThis real-time data is generated at a high rate of speed (literally! üòÑ) and it is imperative to transmit it safely and with the lowest latency possible to the teams (amongst many other things, streaming sensor data can for example be used to predict mechanical failures as they are about to happen) both on-site and over the cloud to their home-bases.Besides latency and throughput, security is another important aspect: ‚ÄúOne key feature of NATS incorporated in this design is isolation of the data between different subscribers (multi-tenancy). Ensuring that a given racing team is the only recipient of their car‚Äôs telemetry data is essential for competition integrity. Thus, teams who connect to the ERDP to receive live telemetry data are only able to access the appropriate data set for them, in real time.‚ÄùThe articleLearn more about how NASCAR uses NATS in the full AWS blog:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/accelerating-motorsports-how-nascar-delivers-real-time-racing-data-to-broadcasters-racing-teams-and-fans/Back to BlogCopyright ¬© NATS Authors 2024NATS is aCloud Native Computing Foundationincubating projectThe Linux Foundation has registered trademarks and uses trademarks.For a list of trademarks of The Linux Foundation, please seeTrademark Usage page.
