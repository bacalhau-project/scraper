It is a single technology that enables applications to securely communicate across any combination of cloud vendors, on-premise, edge, web and mobile, and devices.
NATS consists of a family of open source products that are tightly integrated but can be deployed easily and independently. NATS is being used globally by thousands of companies, spanning use-cases including microservices, edge computing, mobile, IoT and can be used to augment or replace traditional messaging.The NATS Server acts as a central nervous system for building distributed applications. Official clients are available in Go, Rust, JavaScript (Node and Web), TypeScript (Deno), Python, Java, C#, C, Ruby, Elixir and a CLI in addition to 30+ community-contributed clients. Real time data streaming, highly resilient data storage and flexible data retrieval are supported throughJetStream, the next generation streaming platform built into the NATS server.
