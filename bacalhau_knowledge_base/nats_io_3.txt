About NATS
NATS is a connective technology built for the ever increasingly hyper-connected world. It is a single technology that enables applications to securely communicate across any combination of cloud vendors, on-premise, edge, web and mobile, and devices. NATS consists of a family of open source products that are tightly integrated but can be deployed easily and independently. NATS is being used globally by thousands of companies, spanning use-cases including microservices, edge computing, mobile, IoT and can be used to augment or replace traditional messaging.
The NATS Server acts as a central nervous system for building distributed applications. Official clients are available in Go, Rust, JavaScript (Node and Web), TypeScript (Deno), Python, Java, C#, C, Ruby, Elixir and a CLI in addition to 30+ community-contributed clients. Real time data streaming, highly resilient data storage and flexible data retrieval are supported through
[JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/jetstream/)
, the next generation streaming platform built into the NATS server. Check out the full list of
[NATS clients](/download/)
.
NATS was created by Derek Collison, in response to the market need for a simple, secure, and connective technology. NATS is currently deployed in some of the largest cloud platforms, including: VMware, CloudFoundry, Baidu, Siemens, and GE. NATS is 100% free to use under the Apache-2.0 Open Source License.
NATS is unique in its simplicity and performance, and as a result powers some of the largest production environments. You can learn more about NATS in our
[extensive documentation](https://docs.nats.io)
.
The purpose of the roadmap is to communicate the known set of features and changes coming in a release. Each release contains a set of strategic and high-value changes decided by the NATS maintainers. There are several sources of input for this decision making:
