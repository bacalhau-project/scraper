It consists ofscientific papersin the fields ofmathematics,physics,astronomy,electrical engineering,computer science,quantitative biology,statistics,mathematical financeandeconomics, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers areself-archivedon the arXiv repository before publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Some publishers also grant permission for authors to archive the peer-reviewedpostprint. Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million-article milestone on October 3, 2008,[2][3]had hit a million by the end of 2014[4][5]and two million by the end of 2021.[6][7]As of April 2021, the submission rate is about 16,000 articles per month.[8]History[edit]A screenshot of the arXiv taken in 1994,[9]using the browserNCSA Mosaic. At the time,HTML formswere a new technology.arXiv's yearly submission rate growth over 30 years since its beginning with topics labelled by the standard abbreviations used on arxiv.org[10]arXiv was made possible by the compactTeXfile format, which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over theInternetand renderedclient-side.[11]Around 1990,Joanne Cohnbegan emailingphysicspreprints to colleagues as TeX files, but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity.[12]Paul Ginspargrecognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a centralrepositorymailbox stored at theLos Alamos National Laboratory(LANL) that could be accessed from any computer.[13]Additional modes of access were soon added:FTPin 1991,Gopherin 1992, and theWorld Wide Webin 1993.[5][14]The terme-printwas quickly adopted to describe the articles.It began as a physics archive, called theLANLpreprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology and, most recently, statistics. Its originaldomain namewas xxx.lanl.gov. Due to LANL's lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology, in 2001 Ginsparg changed institutions toCornell Universityand changed the name of the repository to arXiv.org.[15]It is now hosted principally by Cornell, with fivemirrorsaround the world.[16]arXiv was an early adopter and promoter ofpreprints.[17]Its success in sharing preprints was one of the precipitating factors that led to the later movement inscientific publishingknown asopen access.[17]Mathematiciansand scientists regularly upload their papers to arXiv.org for worldwide access[18]and sometimes for reviews before they are published inpeer-reviewedjournals. Ginsparg was awarded aMacArthur Fellowshipin 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.[19]The annual budget for arXiv was approximately $826,000 for 2013 to 2017, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, theSimons Foundation(in both gift andchallenge grantforms) and annual fee income from member institutions.[20]This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution. Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers from $1,000 to $4,400. Cornell's goal is to raise at least $504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions.[21]In September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development. Ginsparg was quoted in theChronicle of Higher Educationas saying it "was supposed to be athree-hour tour, not a life sentence".[22]However, Ginsparg remains on the arXiv's Scientific Advisory Board and its Physics Advisory Committee.[23][24]In January 2022, arXiv began assigningDOIsto articles, in collaboration withDataCite.[25]Data format[edit]Each arXiv paper has a unique identifier:YYMM.NNNNN, e.g.1507.00123,YYMM.NNNN, e.g.0704.0001,arch-ive/YYMMNNNfor older papers, e.g.hep-th/9901001.Different versions of the same paper are specified by a version number at the end. For example,1709.08980v1. If no version number is specified, the default is the latest version.arXiv uses a category system. Each paper is tagged with one or more categories. Some categories have two layers. For example,q-fin.TRis the "Trading and Market Microstructure" category within "quantitative finance". Other categories have one layer. For example,hep-exis "high energy physics experiments".Moderation process and endorsement[edit]Although arXiv is notpeer reviewed, a collection of moderators for each area review thesubmissions; they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic,[26]or reject submissions that are not scientific papers, or sometimes for undisclosed reasons.[27]The lists of moderators for many sections of arXiv are publicly available,[28]but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.Additionally, an "endorsement" system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines.[29]Under the system, for categories that use it, an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area.[26]New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all. However, the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry.[30][31]A majority of thee-printsare also submitted tojournalsfor publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal. A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof ofThurston's geometrization conjecture, including thePoincaré conjectureas a particular case, uploaded byGrigori Perelmanin November 2002.[32]Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: "If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there [on the arXiv] – let them go and read about it".[33]Despite this non-traditional method of publication, other mathematicians recognized this work by offering theFields MedalandClay Mathematics Millennium Prizesto Perelman, both of which he refused.[34]While arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such asFermat's Last Theoremusing only high-school mathematics, a 2002 article which appeared inNotices of the American Mathematical Societydescribed those as "surprisingly rare".[35]arXiv generally re-classifies these works, e.g. in "General mathematics", rather than deleting them;[36]however, some authors have voiced concern over the lack of transparency in the arXiv screening process.[27]Submission formats[edit]Papers can be submitted in any of several formats, includingLaTeX, andPDFprinted from aword processorother than TeX or LaTeX. Thesubmissionis rejected by the arXiv software if generating the finalPDFfile fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large. arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.Access[edit]A screenshot of viewing a paper's abstract on arxiv.org in 2021The standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations.Metadatafor arXiv is made available throughOAI-PMH, the standard foropen access repositories.[37]Content is therefore indexed in all major consumers of such data, such asBASE,COREandUnpaywall. As of 2020, the Unpaywall dump links over 500,000 arxiv URLs as theopen accessversion of a work found inCrossRefdata from the publishers, making arXiv a top 10 global host ofgreen open access.Finally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings orRSS feedsof all submissions in them.Copyright status of files[edit]Files on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses:[38]Some arepublic domain, in which case they will have a statement saying so.Some are available under either theCreative Commons4.0Attribution-ShareAlike licenseor the Creative Commons 4.0Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license.Some are copyright to the publisher, but the author has the right to distribute them and has given arXiv a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.Most are copyright to the author, and arXiv has only a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.See also[edit]BioRxivPsyArXivList of academic databases and search enginesList of academic journals by preprint policyList of preprint repositoriesSci-HubCitations[edit]^Steele, Bill (Fall 2012)."Library-managed 'arXiv' spreads scientific advances rapidly and worldwide".Ezra.
