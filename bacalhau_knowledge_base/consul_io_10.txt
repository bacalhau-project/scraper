For example, developers want to deploy new versions of a service in a controlled manner without causing downtime. Bluntly taking old versions down and deploying new versions leads to downtime and can risk exposure to extended outages if unexpected problems emerge.SolutionCentralize traffic shaping with ConsulConsul solves for these use cases including canary testing, A/B tests, blue/green deployment, and soft multi-tenancy (prod/qa/staging sharing compute resources). Developers can shape traffic between services in a methodical manner when introducing a new version of their service. They can gradually direct traffic to the new version and increase the traffic percentage over time, thereby reducing the risks associated with application updates.Customer case studyHow Stripe uses Consul to build service meshHear Stripe's service networking team talk about their multi-region service networking tech stack built on Consul.Read moreTutorialsExplore allTutorialManage traffic with Consul service meshYou will be introduced to Consul service mesh's comprehensive traffic management features.TutorialTraffic splitting for service deploymentsIn this tutorial, you will upgrade service to a new version using the canary deployment strategy.
