Founded in 1868 and named after theAnglo-IrishphilosopherGeorge Berkeley, it is the state's firstland-grant universityand is the founding campus of theUniversity of Californiasystem.[12]Berkeley has an enrollment of more than 45,000 students. The university is organized around fifteen schools of study on the same campus, including theCollege of Chemistry, theCollege of Engineering, and theHaas School of Business. It isclassifiedamong "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".[13]TheLawrence Berkeley National Laboratorywas founded as the university's Radiation Lab before being subsumed by theU.S. Department of Energy.[14]Berkeley was a founding member of theAssociation of American Universitiesand was one of the original eight "Public Ivy" schools. In 2021, the federal funding for campus research and development exceeded $1 billion.[15]Thirty-two libraries also compose theBerkeley library systemwhich is thesixth largest research library by number of volumes heldin theUnited States.[16][17][18]Berkeley students compete in thirtyvarsityathletic sports, and the university is one of eighteen full-member institutions in theAtlantic Coast Conference(ACC). Berkeley's athletic teams, theCalifornia Golden Bears, have also won 107 national championships, 196 individual national titles, and223 Olympic medals(including 121 gold).[19][20]Berkeley'salumni,faculty, and researchersinclude 21Nobel laureates[21]and 19Academy Awardwinners,[22]and the university is also a producer ofRhodes Scholars,[23]Marshall Scholars,[24]andFulbright Scholars.[25]HistoryView from Memorial Glade ofSather Tower(the Campanile), the center of BerkeleySather Tower (the Campanile) looking out overSan Francisco BayandMount TamalpaisMain article:History of the University of California, BerkeleyFoundingMade possible byPresident Lincoln's signing of theMorrill Actin 1862, the University of California was founded in 1868 as the state's first land-grant university, inheriting the land and facilities of the privateCollege of Californiaand the federal-funding eligibility of a public agricultural, mining, and mechanical arts college.[26]The Organic Act states that the "University shall have for its design, to provide instruction and thorough and complete education in all departments of science, literature and art, industrial and professional pursuits, and general education, and also special courses of instruction in preparation for the professions."[27][28]Ten faculty members and forty male students made up the fledgling university when it opened in Oakland in 1869.[29]Frederick Billings, a trustee of the College of California, suggested that a new campus site north of Oakland be named in honor ofAnglo-IrishphilosopherGeorge Berkeley.[30]The university began admitting women the following year.[31]In 1870,Henry Durant, founder of the College of California, became its first president. With the completion of North andSouth Hallsin 1873, the university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 22 female students.[32][33]The first female student to graduate was in 1874, admitted in the first class to include women in 1870.[34]Beginning in 1891,Phoebe Apperson Hearstfunded several programs and new buildings and, in 1898, sponsored an international competition inAntwerp, where French architectÉmile Bénardsubmitted the winning design for a campus master plan. Although the University of California system does not have an officialflagship campus, many scholars and experts consider Berkeley to be its unofficial flagship. It shares this unofficial status with theUniversity of California, Los Angeles.[35][36]20th centuryIn 1905, the University Farm was established nearSacramento, ultimately becoming theUniversity of California, Davis.[37]In 1919, the Los Angeles branch of theCalifornia State Normal Schoolbecame the southern branch of the university, which ultimately became theUniversity of California, Los Angeles.[38]By the 1920s, the number of campus buildings in Berkeley had grown substantially and included twenty structures designed by architectJohn Galen Howard.[39]In 1917, one of the nation's firstROTCprograms was established at Berkeley[40]and its School of Military Aeronautics began training pilots, includingJimmy Doolittle. In 1926, futureFleet AdmiralChester W. Nimitzestablished the firstNaval ROTCunit at Berkeley.[41]Berkeley ROTC alumni include former Secretary of DefenseRobert McNamara, Army Chief of StaffFrederick C. Weyand, sixteen othergeneral officers, ten Navyflag officers, and AFROTC alumna CaptainTheresa Claiborne.[42]In the 1930s,Ernest Orlando Lawrencehelped establish the Radiation Laboratory (nowLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and invented thecyclotron, which won him the Nobel physics prize in 1939.[43]Using the cyclotron, Berkeley professors and Berkeley Lab researchers went on to discover sixteenchemical elements—more than any other university in the world.[44][45]In particular, during World War II and followingGlenn Seaborg's then-secret discovery of plutonium, Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory began to contract with the U.S. Army to develop the atomic bomb. Physics professorJ. Robert Oppenheimerwas named scientific head of the Manhattan Project in 1942.[46][47]Along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley founded and was then a partner in managing two other labs,Los Alamos National Laboratory(1943) andLawrence Livermore National Laboratory(1952).The famous "Bodies Upon the Gears" speech (also known as  "Operation of the Machine") given byMario Savioon the steps of Sproul Hall in 1964.In 1952, theUniversity of Californiareorganized itself into a system of semi-autonomous campuses, with each campus given a chancellor, andClark Kerrbecame Berkeley's first Chancellor, whileRobert Sproulremained in place as the President of the University of California.[48]Berkeley gained a worldwide reputation forpolitical activismin the 1960s. In 1964, theFree Speech Movementorganized student resistance to the university's restrictions on political activities on campus—most conspicuously, student activities related to theCivil Rights Movement.[49][50]The arrest in Sproul Plaza ofJack Weinberg, a recent Berkeley alumnus and chair of CampusCORE, prompted a series of student-led acts of formal remonstrance and civil disobedience that ultimately gave rise to the Free Speech Movement, which movement would prevail and serve as a precedent for studentoppositionto America's involvement in the Vietnam War.[51][52][53]In 1982, theMathematical Sciences Research Institute(MSRI) was established on campus with support from theNational Science Foundationand at the request of three Berkeley mathematicians—Shiing-Shen Chern,Calvin Moore, andIsadore M. Singer. The institute is now widely regarded as a leading center for collaborative mathematical research, drawing thousands of visiting researchers from around the world each year.[54][55][56]21st centuryIn the current century, Berkeley has become less politically active, although more liberal.[57][58]Democrats outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of nine to one, which is a ratio similar to that of American academia generally.[59]The school has become more focused onSTEMdisciplines and fundraising.[60][61][62]In 2007, theEnergy Biosciences Institutewas established with funding fromBPand Stanley Hall, a research facility and headquarters for theCalifornia Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, opened. Supported by a grant from alumnusJames Simons, theSimons Institute for the Theory of Computingwas established in 2012. In 2015, Berkeley and its sister campus,UCSF, established theInnovative Genomics Instituteto developCRISPR gene editing, and, in 2020, an anonymous donor pledged $252 million to help fund a new center for computing and data science. For the 2020 fiscal year, Berkeley set a fundraising record, receiving over $1 billion in gifts and pledges, and two years later, it broke that record, raising over $1.2 billion.[63][60][64][65]ControversiesVarious research ethics, human rights, and animal rights advocates have been in conflict with Berkeley.Native Americanscontended with the school over repatriation of remains from thePhoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.[66]Student activists have urged the university to cut financial ties withTyson FoodsandPepsiCo.[67][68][69]Faculty memberIgnacio Chapelaprominently criticized the university's financial ties toNovartis.[70]PETAhas challenged the university's use of animals for research and argued that it may violate theAnimal Welfare Act.[71][72]Cal'sMemorial Stadiumreopened in September 2012 after renovations. The university incurred a controversial $445 million of debt for the stadium and a new $153 million student athletic center, which it financed with the sale of special stadium endowment seats.[73]The roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20 percent of Cal's athletics' budget; principal repayment begins in 2032 and is scheduled to conclude in 2113.[74]On May 1, 2014, Berkeley was named one of fifty-five higher education institutions under investigation by theU.S. Department of Education'sOffice of Civil Rights"for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by theWhite House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.[75]Investigations continued into 2016, with hundreds of pages of records released in April 2016, showing a pattern of documented sexual harassment and firings of non-tenured staff.[76]On July 25, 2019, Berkeley was removed from theU.S. NewsBest Colleges Rankingfor misreporting statistics. Berkeley had originally reported that its two-year average alumni giving rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 11.6 percent,U.S. Newssaid. The school later toldU.S. Newsthe correct average alumni giving rate for the 2016 fiscal year was just 7.9 percent. The school incorrectly overstated its alumni giving data toU.S. Newssince at least 2014. The alumni giving rate accounts for five percent of the Best Colleges ranking.[77]Berkeley community members have criticized UC Berkeley's increasing enrollment. Berkeley residents filed a lawsuit alleging that the university's expanding enrollment violatedCalifornia Environmental Quality Actand that the area lacked the infrastructure to support more students.[78]Critics of the lawsuit accused these community members ofNIMBYism.[79][80][81]In August 2021, a judge from theSuperior Court of Alameda Countyruled in favor of the residents, and on March 3, 2022, theCalifornia Supreme Courtalso ruled in favor of the residents, saying that the university needed to freeze its admission rates at 2020–2021 levels.[82]On March 11, 2022, state legislators released a proposal to change CEQA to exempt the university from its restrictions.[83]On March 14, Gavin Newsom signed the bill into law.[84]Berkeley has continued to face a housing shortage.[85]Organization and administrationNameOfficially named the "University of California, Berkeley" it is often shortened to "Berkeley" in general reference or in an academic context (Berkeley Law,Berkeley Engineering,Berkeley Haas,Berkeley Public Health) and to "California" or "Cal" particularly when referring to its athletic teams (California Golden Bears).[86][87][88]In August 2022, a university task force was formed which recommended renaming the athletic identity to "Cal Berkeley" to further tie the athletic brand to academic prestige, and reduce public confusion.[89]GovernanceThe University of California is governed by a twenty-six memberBoard of Regents, eighteen of whom are appointed by theGovernor of Californiato 12-year terms. The board also has sevenex officiomembers, a student regent, and a non-voting student regent-designate.[90]Prior to 1952, Berkeley was the University of California, so the university president was also Berkeley's chief executive. In 1952, the university reorganized itself into a system of semi-autonomous campuses, with each campus having its own chief executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice-chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the fifteen colleges and schools report to the executive vice chancellor and provost, Berkeley's chief academic officer.[91]Twenty-three presidents and chancellors have led Berkeley since its founding.[92][48]Presidents1868–1869Henry Durant1869–1870John LeConte1870–1872Henry Durant1872–1875Daniel Coit Gilman1875–1881John LeConte1881–1885W.T.

Christ2024–presentRichard LyonsFundingSee also:University of California financesWith the exception of government contracts, public support is apportioned to Berkeley and the other campuses of the University of California system through the UC Office of the President and accounts for 12 percent of Berkeley's total revenues.[93]Berkeley has benefited from private philanthropy and alumni and their foundations have given to the university for operations and capital expenditures with the more prominent beingJ. Paul Getty,Ann Getty,Sanford Diller,Donald Fisher,Flora Lamson Hewlett, David Schwartz (Bio-Rad) and members of the Haas (Walter A. Haas,Rhoda Haas Goldman,Walter A. Haas Jr.,Peter E. Haas,Bob Haas) family.[94]Berkeley has also benefited from benefactors beyond its alumni ranks, notable among which areMark ZuckerbergandPriscilla Chan;Vitalik Buterin,Patrick Collison,John Collison, theRon Conwayfamily,Daniel Gross,Dustin MoskovitzandCari Tuna, along withJane Streetprincipals;BP; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, billionaireSir Li Ka-Shing, Israeli-Russian billionaireYuri Milner,Thomas and Stacey Siebel,Sanford and Joan Weill, and professorGordon Rausser($50 million gift in 2020).[94]Hundreds of millions of dollars have been given anonymously.[95]The 2008–13 "Campaign for Berkeley" raised $3.13 billion from 281,855 donors, and the "Light the Way" campaign, which concluded at the end of 2023, has raised over $6.2 billion.[96]AcademicsFaculty and departmentsWheeler Hall, home to Berkeley's largest lecture hall, was the location of aNobel Prizeconferral duringWWII.The interior of theHearst Mining Building, dedicated byPhoebe Hearstin honor of her late husband,George.Berkeley is a large, primarily residential research university with a majority of its enrolment in undergraduate programs but also offering a comprehensive doctoral program.[13]The university has beenaccreditedby theWestern Association of Schools and CollegesSenior College and University Commission since 1949.[97]The university operates on asemester calendarand awarded 8,725 bachelor's, 3,286 master's or professional and 1,272 doctoral degrees in 2018–2019.[98]There are 1,789 full-time and 886 part-time faculty members among the university's academic enterprise which is organized into fifteen colleges and schools that comprise 180 departments and 80 interdisciplinary units offering over 350 degree programs. Colleges serve both undergraduate and graduate students, while schools are generally graduate only, though some offer undergraduate majors or minors:College of ChemistryCollege of Computing, Data Science, and SocietyCollege of EngineeringCollege of Environmental DesignCollege of Letters and ScienceGoldman School of Public PolicyGraduate School of JournalismHaas School of BusinessRausser College of Natural ResourcesSchool of InformationSchool of EducationSchool of LawSchool of Public HealthSchool of Social WelfareWertheim School of OptometryUC Berkeley ExtensionUndergraduate programsDoe Memorial LibraryThe four-year, full-time undergraduate program offers 107 bachelor's degrees across the Haas School of Business (1), College of Chemistry (5), College of Engineering (20), College of Environmental Design (4), College of Letters and Science (67), Rausser College of Natural Resources (10), and individual majors (2).[99]The most popular majors areelectrical engineering and computer sciences,political science,molecularandcell biology,environmental science, andeconomics.[100]Requirements for undergraduate degrees include an entry-level writing requirement before enrollment (typically fulfilled by minimum scores on standardized admissions exams such as the SAT or ACT), completing coursework on "American History and Institutions" before or after enrollment by taking an introductory class, passing an "American Cultures Breadth" class at Berkeley, as well as requirements for reading and composition and specific requirements declared by the department and school.[101]Graduate and professional programsHaas School of BusinessBerkeley has a "comprehensive" graduate program, with high coexistence with the programs offered to undergraduates, and offers interdisciplinary graduate programs with the medical schools at theUniversity of California, San FranciscoandStanford University. The university offersMaster of Arts,Master of Science,Master of Fine Arts, andPhDdegrees in addition to professional degrees such as theJuris Doctor,Master of Business Administration,Master of Public Health, andMaster of Design.[13][102]The university awarded 963 doctoral degrees and 3,531 master's degrees in 2017.[103]Admission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. Most graduate students are supported by fellowships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships.[103]Library systemMain article:University of California, Berkeley Library SystemThe on-campusUniversity of California Museum of Paleontologyhosts alife-size replicaof aT-rex.Doe Libraryserves as theBerkeley library system's reference, periodical, and administrative center, while most of the main collections reside in the subterranean Gardner Main Stacks and Moffitt Undergraduate Library.

The school's first ranking in 1906 placed it among the top six schools ("Big Six") in the nation. In 1934, it ranked second, tied withColumbiaand theUniversity of Chicago, behind onlyHarvard; in 1957, it was ranked as the only school second to Harvard. In 1964, Berkeley was named the "best balanced distinguished university", meaning the school had not only the most top departments but also the highest percentage of top ranking departments in its school. The school in 1993 was the only remaining member of the original 1906 "Big Six", along with Harvard; in that year Berkeley ranked first.[122]TheAmerican Council on Education, a private non-profit association, ranked Berkeley tenth in 1934. However, by 1942, private funding had helped Berkeley rise to second place, behind only Harvard, based on the number of distinguished departments.[48]In 1985,Yale Universityadmissions officer Richard Moll publishedPublic Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universitieswhich named Berkeley a "Public Ivy".[123][124][125][126]Since its inaugural 1990 reputational survey,Times Higher Educationhas considered Berkeley to be one of the world's "six super brands" along with theUniversity of Oxfordand theUniversity of Cambridge,Harvard University,MIT, andStanford University.[127][128][129][130][131]The 2010United States National Research Council Rankingsidentified Berkeley as having the highest number of top-ranked doctoral programs in the nation. Berkeley doctoral programs that received a #1 ranking included English, German, Political Science, Geography, Agricultural and Resource Economics, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genomics, Epidemiology, Plant Biology, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Engineering.[132]Admissions and enrollmentUndergraduate demographics as of Fall 2020Race and ethnicity[133]TotalAsian35%35White22%22Hispanic19%19Foreign national13%13Other[a]9%9Black2%2Economic diversityLow-income[b]22%22Affluentormiddle class[c]78%78For Fall 2022, Berkeley's total enrollment was 45,745: 32,831 undergraduate and 12,914 graduate students, with women accounting for 56% of undergraduates and 49% of graduate and professional students. It had 128,226 freshman applicants and accepted 14,614 (11.4%). Among enrolled freshman, the average unweighted GPA was 3.90.[134]Berkeley's enrollment ofNational Merit Scholarswas third in the nation until 2002, when participation in the National Merit program was discontinued.[135]For 2019, Berkeley ranked fourth in enrollment of recipients of theNational Merit $2,500 Scholarship(132 scholars).[136][137]27% of admitted students receive federalPell grants.[138]Berkeley students are eligible for a variety of public and private financial aid. Inquiries are processed through the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office, although schools such as the Haas School of Business[139]andBerkeley Law,[140]have their own financial aid offices.Fall Freshman Profile[134]202220212020201920182017201620152014Applicants128,226109,59788,07687,39889,62185,05782,57178,92373,794Admits14,61415,85215,44814,67613,30814,55214,42913,33213,338Admit rate11.4%14.5%17.5%16.8%14.8%17.1%17.5%16.9%18.1%Enrolled6,7266,8096,0526,4546,0126,3796,2535,8325,813SAT(mid-50%)N/A*N/A*1300–15201330–15201300–15301300–15401930–22901870–22501840–2230ACT(average)N/A*N/A*31313132323231GPA(unweighted)3.903.873.863.893.893.913.863.873.85* Berkeley began test-blind admissions in 2021.Discoveries and innovationSimplified evolution ofUnixsystems andBSDforksNatural sciencesAtomic bomb– Physics professorJ.

Of the remaining acres, approximately 200-acres are occupied by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; other facilities above the main campus include theLawrence Hall of Scienceand several research units, notably theSpace Sciences Laboratory, theMathematical Sciences Research Institute, an 800-acre (320-hectare) ecological preserve, theUniversity of California Botanical Gardenand a recreation center in Strawberry Canyon. Portions of the mostly undeveloped, eastern area of the campus are actually within theCity of Oakland; these portions extend from theClaremont Resortnorth through thePanoramic Hillneighborhood toTilden Park.[183]To the west of the central campus is thedowntown business district of Berkeley; to the northwest is the neighborhood of North Berkeley, including the so-calledGourmet Ghetto, a commercial district known for high quality dining due to the presence of such world-renowned restaurants asChez Panisse. Immediately to the north is a quiet residential neighborhood known asNorthsidewith a large graduate student population;[184]situated north of that are the upscale residential neighborhoods of theBerkeley Hills. Immediately southeast of campus lies fraternity row and beyond that theClark Kerr Campusand an upscale residential area namedClaremont. Thearea south of the universityincludes student housing andTelegraph Avenue, one of Berkeley's main shopping districts with stores, street vendors and restaurants catering to college students and tourists. In addition, the university also owns land to the northwest of the main campus, a married student housing complex in the nearby town of Albany ("Albany Village" and the "Gill Tract"), and afield research stationseveral miles to the north inRichmond, California.Bancroft LibraryTheUC Botanical Garden, located in theBerkeley Hillsand by theLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.The campus is home to several museums including theUniversity of California Museum of Paleontology, theBerkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, and theLawrence Hall of Science. The Museum of Paleontology, found in the lobby of the Valley Life Sciences Building, showcases a variety of dinosaur fossils including a complete cast of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The campus also offers resources for innovation and entrepreneurship, such as the Big Ideas Competition, the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology, and the Berkeley Haas Innovation Lab.[185]The campus is also home to theUniversity of California Botanical Garden, with more than 12,000 individual species.360-degree-view of the UC Berkeley campusArchitectureSouth Hall(1873), one of the two original buildings of the University of California, still stands on the Berkeley campus.What is considered the historic campus today was the result of the 1898 "International Competition for thePhoebe HearstArchitectural Plan for the University of California," funded byWilliam Randolph Hearst's mother and initially held in the Belgian city ofAntwerp; eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco in 1899.[186]The winner was FrenchmanÉmile Bénard, who refused to personally supervise the implementation of his plan and the task was subsequently given to architecture professorJohn Galen Howard. Howard designed over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and 1960s.The structures forming the "classical core" of the campus were built in theBeaux-ArtsClassical style, and includeHearst Greek Theatre,Hearst Memorial Mining Building,Doe Memorial Library, California Hall,Wheeler Hall, Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall,Sather Gate, and theSather Tower(nicknamed "the Campanile" after its architectural inspiration,St Mark's Campanilein Venice), the tallest university clock tower in the United States.[187]Buildings he regarded as temporary and non-academic were designed in shingle orCollegiate Gothicstyles; examples of these are North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall. Many of Howard's designs are recognizedCalifornia Historical Landmarks[188]and are listed on theNational Register of Historic Places.Built in 1873 in aVictorianSecond-Empire-style, South Hall, designed by David Farquharson, is the oldest university building in California. It, and theFrederick Law Olmsted-designedPiedmont Avenueeast of the main campus, are two of the only surviving examples of the nineteenth-century campus. Other notable architects and firms whose work can be found in the campus and surrounding area areBernard Maybeck[189](Faculty Club);Julia Morgan(Hearst Women's Gymnasium andJulia Morgan Hall);William Wurster(Stern Hall); Moore Ruble Yudell (Haas School of Business);Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects(C.V. Starr East Asian Library), andDiller Scofidio + Renfro(Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive).Natural featuresThe south fork ofStrawberry Creek, as seen between Dwinelle Hall andLower Sproul Plaza.Flowing into the main campus are two branches ofStrawberry Creek. The south fork enters a culvert upstream of the recreational complex at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon and passes beneathCalifornia Memorial Stadiumbefore appearing again in Faculty Glade. It then runs through the center of the campus before disappearing underground at the west end of campus. The north fork appears just east ofUniversity Houseand runs through the glade north of the Valley Life Sciences Building, the original site of the Campus Arboretum.Trees in the area date from the founding of the university. The campus features numerous wooded areas, including:Founders' Rock, Faculty Glade, Grinnell Natural Area, and theEucalyptusGrove, which is both the tallest stand of such trees in the world and the tallest stand of hardwood trees in North America.[190]The campus sits on theHayward Fault, which runs directly through California Memorial Stadium.[191]Student life and traditionsFans atopTightwad Hillwatch theCal Band, with views of thestadiumand theSan Francisco Bay.The official university mascot isOski the Bear, who debuted in 1941. Previously, live bear cubs were used as mascots at Memorial Stadium until it was decided in 1940 that a costumed mascot would be a better alternative. Named after theOski-wow-wowyell, he is cared for by the Oski Committee, whose members have exclusive knowledge of the identity of the costume-wearer.[192]TheUniversity of California Marching Band, which has served the university since 1891, performs at every home football game and at select road games as well. A smaller subset of the Cal Band, the Straw Hat Band, performs at basketball games, volleyball games, and other campus and community events.[193]The UC Rally Committee, formed in 1901, is the official guardian of California's Spirit and Traditions. Wearing their traditional blue and gold rugbies, Rally Committee members can be seen at all major sporting and spirit events. Committee members are charged with the maintenance of the six Cal flags, the large California banner overhanging the Memorial Stadium Student Section andHaas Pavilion, the California Victory Cannon, Card Stunts andThe Big "C"among other duties. The Rally Committee is also responsible for safekeeping of theStanford Axewhen it is in Cal's possession.[194]Overlooking the main Berkeley campus from the foothills in the east, The Big "C" is an important symbol of California school spirit. The Big "C" has its roots in an early 20th-century campus event called "Rush," which pitted the freshman and sophomore classes against each other in a race up Charter Hill that often developed into a wrestling match. It was eventually decided to discontinue Rush and, in 1905, the freshman and sophomore classes banded together in a show of unity to build "the Big C."[195]Students invented the college football tradition ofcard stunts. Then known as Bleacher Stunts, they were first performed during the 1910Big Gameand consisted of two stunts: a picture of the Stanford Axe and a large blue "C" on a white background. The tradition is continued today by the Rally Committee in the Calstudent sectionand incorporates complicated motions, for example tracing the Cal script logo on a blue background with an imaginary yellow pen.[196]The California Victory Cannon, placed onTightwad Hilloverlooking the stadium, is fired before every football home game, after every score, and after every Cal victory. First used in the 1963 Big Game, it was originally placed on the sidelines before moving to Tightwad Hill in 1971. The only time the cannon ran out of ammunition was during a game againstPacificin 1991, when Cal scored 12 touchdowns.[197]The Cal Mic Men, a standard at home football games, has recently expanded to involve basketball and volleyball. The traditional role comes from students holding megaphones and yelling, but now includes microphones, a dedicated platform during games, and the direction of the entire student section.[198]Student housingMain article:Housing at the University of California, BerkeleyBerkeley students are offered a variety of housing options, including university-owned or affiliated residences, private residences, fraternities and sororities, and cooperative housing (co-ops). Berkeley students, and those of other local schools, have the option of living in one of the twenty cooperative houses participating in the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC), anonprofithousing cooperativenetwork consisting of 20 residences and 1250 member-owners.[199]Fraternities and sororitiesAbout three percent of undergraduate men and nine percent of undergraduate women—or 3,400 of total undergraduates—are active in Berkeley's Greek system.[200]University-sanctioned fraternities and sororities comprise over 60 houses affiliated with four Greek councils.[201][202]Student-run organizationsAssociated Students of the University of California (ASUC)Main article:Associated Students of the University of CaliforniaWellness Room sleep pods: part of a program created by the ASUC, UC Berkeley's official student association.TheAssociated Students of the University of California(ASUC) is the officialstudent associationthat controls funding for student groups and organizes on-campus student events. The two main political parties are "Student Action"[203]and "CalSERVE."[204]The organization was founded in 1887 and has an annual operating budget of $1.7 million (excluding the budget of the Graduate Assembly of the ASUC), in addition to various investment assets. Its alumni include multiple State Senators, Assemblymembers, and White House Administration officials.[205]Media and publicationsBerkeley's student-run online television station,CalTV, was formed in 2005 and broadcasts online. It is run by students with a variety of backgrounds and majors. Since the mid-2010s, it has been a program of theASUC.[206]Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper isThe Daily Californian. Founded in 1871,The Daily Calbecame independent in 1971 after the campus administration fired three senior editors for encouraging readers to take backPeople's Park. The Daily Californian has both a print and online edition. Berkeley's FMStudent radio station,KALX, broadcasts on 90.7 MHz. It is run largely by volunteers, including both students and community members. Berkeley also features an assortment of student-run publications:California Law Review,law journalpublished byBerkeley Law, est. 1912.Berkeley Poetry Review, nationalpoetry journal, est. 1974.Berkeley Fiction Review, Americanliterary magazine, est. 1981.Heuristic Squelch,satirical newspaper, est. 1991.California Patriot,conservativepolitical magazine, est. 2000.Berkeley Political Review,nonpartisanpolitical magazine, est. 2001.Caliber Magazine, an "everything magazine," featuring articles and blogs on a wide range of topics, est. 2008.B-Side, music magazine, est. 2013.Smart Ass,liberalmagazine, est. 2015.Berkeley Economic Review,economicsjournal, est. 2016.Business Berkeley,Haasundergraduate journal.Student groups"DeCal" redirects here.

Berkeley Consulting, founded in 1996, has served over 140 companies across the high-tech, retail, banking, and non-profit sectors.[210]ImagiCal has been the college chapter of theAmerican Advertising Federationat Berkeley since the late 1980s.[211]The team competes annually in the National Student Advertising Competition, with students from disparate majors working together on a marketing case underwritten by a corporate sponsor. TheBerkeley Forumis a nonpartisan student organization that hosts panels, debates, and speeches across a variety of fields.[212]Past speakers includeSenatorRand Paul, entrepreneur and venture capitalistPeter Thiel, andKhan AcademyfounderSalman Khan.UC Berkeley Symphony OrchestraDemocratic Education at Cal, or DeCal, is a program that promotes the creation of professor-sponsored, student-facilitated classes.[213]DeCal arose out of the 1960sFree Speech movementand was officially established in 1981. The program offers around 150 courses on a vast range of subjects that appeal to the student community, including classes on theRubik's Cube,blockchain,web design, metamodernism,cooking, Jewish art,3D animation, andbioprinting.[214]The campus is home to severala cappellagroups, including Drawn to Scale, Artists in Resonance, Berkeley Dil Se, theUC Men's Octet, theCalifornia Golden Overtones, DeCadence, and Noteworthy. TheUniversity of California Men's Octetwas founded in 1948. Since 1967, students and staff jazz musicians have had an opportunity to perform and study with theUniversity of California Jazz Ensembles. For several decades it hosted the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, part of the American Collegiate Jazz Festival, a competitive forum for student musicians. PCCJF brought jazz artists includingHubert Laws,Sonny Rollins,Freddie Hubbard, andEd Shaughnessyto the Berkeley campus as performers. Berkeley also hosts other performing arts groups in comedy, dance, acting and instrumental music.Engineering Student TeamsGiven Berkeley'sSTEMeducation, there are a variety of student-run engineering teams that focus on winning design and engineering competitions.
Berkeley has two prominentamateur rocketryteams: Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB)[215]and Space Technologies and Rocketry (STAR).[216]Both have launched solid-fuelsounding rocketsand are currently developingliquid propellant rockets. The university also has twoFormula SAEteams: Berkeley Formula Racing[217]and Formula Electric Berkeley.[218]Both of these teams participate in Formula SAE–run competitions, with the former focusing on internal combustion engines and the latter on electric motors. Berkeley has a number of other vehicle teams, including CalSol,[219]CalSMV,[220]and Human Powered Vehicle.[221]AthleticsMain article:California Golden BearsThe base of theCalifornia Memorial StadiumThe interior ofHaas Pavilionduring aCal Basketballgame.The university's athletic teams are known as theCalifornia Golden Bears, often shortened to "Cal Bears" or just "Cal," and were historically members of theNCAA Division IPac-12 Conference(Pac-12). Cal is also a member of theMountain Pacific Sports Federationin several sports not sponsored by the Pac-12 and theAmerica East Conferencein women'sfield hockey. In 2024, Cal joined theAtlantic Coast Conference(ACC).[222]The first school colors, established in 1873 by a committee of students, wereYale Blueand gold.[223][224]Yale Blue was originally chosen because many of the university's inaugural faculty were Yale graduates, including Henry Durant, its first president. Blue and gold were specified and made the official colors of the university and the state colors of California in 1955.[223][225]In 2014, the athletic department specified a darker blue.[226][227]TheCalifornia Golden Bearshave won national championships in baseball (2), men's basketball (2), men's crew (15), women's crew (3), football (5), men's golf (1), men's gymnastics (4), men's lacrosse (1), men's rugby (26), softball (1), men's swimming & diving (4), women's swimming & diving (3), men's tennis (1), men's track & field (1), and men's water polo (13). Students and alumni have also won207 Olympic medals.[228]California finished in first place in the 2007–08 Fall U.S. Sports Academy Directors' Cup standings (now theNACDA Directors' Cup), a competition measuring the best overall collegiate athletic programs in the country, with points awarded for national finishes in NCAA sports.[229]It finished the 2007–08 competition in seventh place with 1119 points.[230]Most recently, California finished in third place in the 2010–11 NACDA Directors' Cup with 1219.50 points, finishing behind Stanford and Ohio State. This is California's highest ever finish in the Director's Cup.[231]The Golden Bears' traditional arch-rival is theStanford Cardinal, and the most anticipated sporting event between the two universities is the annual football match dubbed theBig Game, celebrated with spirit events on both campuses. Since 1933, the winner of the Big Game has been awarded custody ofthe Stanford Axe. Other sporting games between these rivals have related names such as the Big Splash (water polo) or the Big Kick (soccer).[232]Notable alumni, faculty, and staffFaculty and staffFor a more comprehensive list, seeList of University of California, Berkeley faculty.University of California Radiation Laboratory staff on the magnet yoke for the 60-inch cyclotron, 1938; Nobel prize-winnersErnest Lawrence,Edwin McMillan, andLuis Alvarezare shown, in addition toJ.
