We want to thank all of the people who contributed to this release through reporting issues and code contributions! Ifyouare interested in contributing, please check outall the ways you can!This release was a smaller one than the prior few, but there are still some key areas to cover, including:Process purge replay properly on startupDaisy-chained leafnodes losing interestOptimize KV get for large key spaces and small messagesRemediate potential panic scenariosFor the entirety of the improvements and fixes, check out therelease notes.🗑️ Process purge replay properly on startupPurge is an on-demand operation that can be applied to a stream to delete a subset of messages in the stream. A purge operation takes a fewopt-in optionsincluding:sequenceto purge all messages up to, but not including the message with the sequencesubjectto purge all message matching the subject (wildcards supported)keepoption indicating the number of newest messages to keep, having all previous messages deletedIf none of these options are set, all messages in the stream will be deleted.An issue was observed where a purge using one of these options, followed by immediately restarting servers in a cluster could resort to an unintentionalfullpurge of a stream.The probability of this occurring in practice is fairly low, but given the risk of data loss, it was clearly flagged as high priority and this release introduces the fix to apply thecorrectpurge. That said, if you do not perform on-demand filtered purges, there is no risk of this bug.Relevant PRs#4212#4213🔗 Daisy-chained leafnodes losing interestLeafnodesare leveraged to extend an existing NATS system (cluster/supercluster), providing isolation of NATS traffic bound to explicit accounts and bridging separate operational and security boundaries.In practice, leafnodes are typically deployed at edge locations or devices where messaging, streaming, etc. can be leveraged by co-located applications. If/when these leafnodes are connected to ahubcluster, data can synchronize in either direction.For some use cases, there may be a need todaisy-chainleafnodes from other leafnodes rather than directly to thehub. Since each leafnode can be configured with different operational and security boundaries, each daisy-chainlayercould apply different policies in terms of account binding or security bridging.For some daisy-chained setups, there was a regression introduced in 2.9.17 which causedinterest propagationof subjects to not fully traverse these layers, resulting in messages not being delivered to all interested subscribers.Relevant PRs#4207💨 Optimize KV get for large key spaces and small messagesFor those new to theKey-Valuecapability in NATS, it is a client abstraction on top of a standard stream. There are various stream configurations that are used to ultimately make the stream behave like a key-value store, such as setting theMaxMsgsPerSubjectlimit to enforce a limit on the number of messages that can be retained per subject. From a key-value standpoint, each subject corresponds to a key and the message data correspond to the key’svalue.It is a common use case to use key-value stores for caches that may have a large number of keys for high cardinality identifiers, such asuser_id. Prior to this release, there was a fairly strong degradation of key-valuegetperformance as the number of keys increased. This was particularly noticeable when the value size was small.An optimization was introduced that essentially skips an unnecessary scan operation for this workload that literally 10x’ed the operations per second. See thebeforeandaftercomparison if you are curious!Relevant PRs#4235😰 Remediate potential panic scenariosThe NATS community is fantastic and every so often we get contributions from folks who are merely perusing the source code and observing improvements that can be made. This contribution was just that.A couple of folks from InfoWatch observed a few areas in the code where panic scenarios could arise and remediated them, putting in place guards where appropriate.Relevant PRs#4214ConclusionAmong the handful of other fixes and improvements, if any of these affect you, please update your NATS system and provide us feedback!
