Go OS/Arch: linux/amd64Also, we use 3 etcd 2.1.0 alpha-stage members to form cluster to get base performance. etcd’s commit head is atc7146bd5, which is the same as the one that we use inetcd 2.1 benchmark.TestingBootstrap another machine and use thehey HTTP benchmark toolto send requests to each etcd member.

The reason is that etcd records store metrics for each store operation. The metrics is important for monitoring and debugging, so this is acceptable.write QPS to leader is increased by 20~30%. This is because we decouple raft main loop and entry apply loop, which avoids them blocking each other.write QPS to all servers is increased by 30~80% because follower could receive latest commit index earlier and commit proposals faster.FeedbackWas this page helpful?YesNoGlad to hear it!
