Community Update at The London NATS User Group Meetup
Brian Flannery — November 9, 2015

[Go London](https://www.meetup.com/GO-London/)
! Meetups), and Milos Gajdos (co-organizer of the
[Kubernetes London](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-London/)
Meetups) present as well. I enjoyed meeting everyone, and getting your feedback after the talks.

[NATS.io website](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-site)! New[docs](https://nats.io/documentation/)section, new content across the site, and most importantly, it is all open source! If you’d like to update content, do so via GoHugo, and send us a PR we’re looking forward to reviewing those!
- Great monitoring tools such as
