Install
Requirements
Before installing etcd, see the following pages:
Install pre-built binaries
The easiest way to install etcd is from pre-built binaries:
Download the compressed archive file for your platform from
[Releases](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/), choosing release[v3.6.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.6.0-alpha.0)or later.Unpack the archive file. This results in a directory containing the binaries.
Add the executable binaries to your path. For example, rename and/or move the binaries to a directory in your path (like
/usr/local/bin
), or add the directory created by the previous step to your path.From a shell, test that
etcd
is in your path:$ etcd --version etcd Version: 3.6.0-alpha.0 ...
Build from source
If you have [Go version 1.21+](https://golang.org/doc/install), you can build etcd from
source by following these steps:
[Download the etcd repo as a zip file](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/archive/v3.6.0-alpha.0.zip)and unzip it, or clone the repo using the following command.$ git clone -b v3.6.0-alpha.0 https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd.git
To build from
main@HEAD
, omit the-b v3.6.0-alpha.0
flag.Change directory:
$ cd etcd
Run the build script:
$ ./scripts/build.sh
The binaries are under the
bin
directory.Add the full path to the
bin
directory to your path, for example:$ export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/bin"
Test that
etcd
is in your path:$ etcd --version
Installation via OS packages
Disclaimer: etcd installations through OS package managers can deliver outdated versions since they are not being automatically maintained nor officially supported by etcd project. Therefore use OS packages with caution.
There are various ways of installing etcd on different operating systems and these are just some examples how it can be done.
MacOS (Homebrew)
- Update homebrew:
$ brew update
- Install etcd:
$ brew install etcd
- Verify install
$ etcd --version
Linux
Although installing etcd through many major Linux distributions’ official repositories and package managers is possible, the published versions can be significantly outdated. So, installing this way is strongly discouraged.
The recommended way to install etcd on Linux is either through [pre-built binaries](#install-pre-built-binaries) or by using Homebrew.
Homebrew on Linux
[Homebrew can run on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux), and can provide recent software versions.
Prerequisites
Update Homebrew:
$ brew update
Procedure
Install using
brew
:$ brew install etcd
Result
Verify installation by getting the version:
$ etcd --version etcd Version: 3.6.0-alpha.0 ...
Installation as part of Kubernetes installation
Installation on Kubernetes, using a statefulset or helm chart
The etcd project does not currently maintain a helm chart, however you can follow the instructions provided by [Bitnami’s etcd Helm chart](https://bitnami.com/stack/etcd/helm).
Installation check
For a slightly more involved sanity check of your installation, see
[Quickstart](/docs/v3.6/quickstart/).
