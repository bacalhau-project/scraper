Paper TrailBlogCAP confusion: Problems with Partition ToleranceApril 27, 2010Over on theCloudera blogIâ€™ve written anarticlethat should be of interest to readers of this blog.Iâ€™m no great fan of the ubiquity of the CAP theorem - itâ€™s a solid impossibility result which appeals to the theorist in me, but it doesnâ€™t capture every fundamental tension in a distributed system. For example: we make our systems distributed across more than one machine usually for reasons of performance and to eliminate a single point of failure. Neither of these motivations are captured verbatim by the CAP theorem. Thereâ€™s more to designing distributed systems!In this, I agree with Stonebraker; itâ€™s the erroneous representation of â€˜partition toleranceâ€™ that I found very strange. Iâ€™ve been a good deal more forceful in private about this than I have in public ðŸ™‚Â©  - 2023 Â·Paper TrailÂ·
