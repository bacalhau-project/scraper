For example:DNSSecoffers a human-meaningful, secure naming scheme, but is not decentralized as it relies on trusted root-servers;.onionaddresses andbitcoinaddresses are secure and decentralized but not human-meaningful; andI2Puses name translation services which are secure (as they run locally) and provide human-meaningful names – but fail to provide unique entities when used globally in a decentralised network without authorities.[a]Solutions[edit]Several systems that exhibit all three properties of Zooko's triangle include:Computer scientistNick Szabo's paper "Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority" illustrated that all three properties can be achievedup tothe limits ofByzantine fault tolerance.[2]ActivistAaron Swartzdescribed a naming system based onBitcoinemploying Bitcoin's distributed blockchain as a proof-of-work to establish consensus of domain name ownership.[3]These systems remain vulnerable toSybil attack,[4]but are secure under Byzantine assumptions.TheoreticianCurtis Yarvinimplemented a decentralized version of IP addresses inUrbitthat hash to four-syllable, human-readable names.[5]Several platforms implement refutations of Zooko's conjecture, including:Twister(which use Swartz' system with a bitcoin-like system),Blockstack(separate blockchain),Namecoin(separate blockchain),LBRY(separate blockchain – content discovery, ownership, andpeer-to-peerfile-sharing),[citation needed]Monero,OpenAlias,[6]Ethereum Name Service, and theHandshake Protocol.[7]See also[edit]PetnameGNU Name SystemCAP theoremNotes[edit]^Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn has since deleted the original blogpostReferences[edit]^Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn."Names: Decentralized, Secure, Human-Meaningful: Choose Two".
