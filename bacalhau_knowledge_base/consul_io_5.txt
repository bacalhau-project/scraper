Tutorial
Network infrastructure automation with Consul-Terraform-Sync
In this tutorial you will learn how to install Consul-Terraform-Sync and configure it to communicate and react to your Consul datacenter.
Use case
Consul-Terraform-Sync allows for the automation of various networking tasks and workflows based on changes observed by Consul.
Challenge
New technologies have emerged in recent years to help accelerate application deployment times. However, legacy systems and old practices cannot keep up with the rate of change of modern applications. If an event occurs that auto-scales additional service instances, networking and security teams are oftentimes still dealing with manual ticket-driven processes that can slow down solution delivery and introduce a higher likelihood of misconfiguration.
Solution
Adopting network infrastructure automation (NIA) with Consul-Terraform-Sync ensures networking and security infrastructure safely adapts to changes. Consul-Terraform-Sync automates various networking tasks and workflows based on changes observed by Consul. The tasks can be triggered by different events, like the scaling of service instances, change of service address or port number, and updates to service tags, meta, or health. This leads to improved delivery times and greatly reduces the chances of misconfigurations.

In this whiteboard video, HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar shows why it's crucial — in the cloud adoption era — to use infrastructure as code not only for automating and templatizing your system's required compute and database resources, but also its networking infrastructure, such as firewalls, load balancers, routers, etc.
